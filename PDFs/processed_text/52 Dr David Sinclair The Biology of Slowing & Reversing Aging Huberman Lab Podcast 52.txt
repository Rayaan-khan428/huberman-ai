00:07:45 “Aging Disease” vs. Longevity & Anti-Aging

use code Huberman get $5 off. now conversation Dr. David
Sinclair. Thank coming. - Thanks here. good see you. -
mate way, toasting 11:00 AM. Unlike podcasts, we, well,
don't drink alcohol, boring way. truly, thanks here, ton
questions you. go way back sense, doesn't mean don't
many, many questions aging, longevity, lifespan, actionable protocols
increase long live, et cetera. just want start off simple
question. not even sure answer to, difference
longevity, anti-aging aging disease? associate
statement, aging disease. - Right? Well, longevity academic way
describe research. Anti-aging kind thing, got bad rap
used whole bunch people don't know talking
about. really don't like term anti-aging, aging disease longevity
perfectly valid ways talk subject. talk aging disease.


started research, disease Harvard Medical School, considered,
something wrong you. rare thing, less 50%
population, definitely disease, people work whole lives try
cure condition. looked up, definition aging says,
well, deterioration health sickness can die it, typically do.
Something sounds pretty much like disease, caveat
half population gets condition, aging, put different bucket. first
all, outrageous, 'cause just totally arbitrary cutoff. think this,
ignoring major 'cause diseases. Aging 80 90% cause
heart disease, Alzheimer's. didn't get old bodies stayed youthful,
not get diseases. actually showing lab is, turn
clock back, tissues, diseases go away. aging problem instead
through, last 200 years, sticking band-aids diseases
already occurred aging late. couple things.
One want slow aging don't get diseases
occur, don't just take bandaid on, reverse age body

00:10:23 Causes Aging? Epigenome

diseases will go away. - clarifies lot me, thank you. Can point
one specific general phenomenon body underlies aging? - Yeah, well,
contentious scientists like come new hypothesis. build
careers. fortunately two thousands, settled eight nine major
causes aging. call hallmarks 'cause causes little bit strong,
eight nine causes, least first time allowed us come around talk
together. put pizza everyone got equal weighting, equal slices.
that, way, trying kill field,
horrible. - Interesting guys work aging trying kill other. -
Yeah, isn't it? Well kill other's careers. Well like think fairly generous,
one kids old guard really didn't like new guard. just came
along 1990s said, free radicals don't much. actually genes called
longevity genes. caused whole ruckus. competition
never happened, Nobel prize this. just led lot
competition. go meetings people shout backstab,


horrible. unfortunately two thousands, rallied around new
map aging causes hallmarks. think one slice
pizza way larger others. can get that, information
cell call epigenome. - Well tell us little bit epigenome,
frame us will, get ways one can adjust epigenome
positive ways. - Yeah, science, like do, reductionist boil
actually ended boiling, aging equation, loss
information due entropy. hard thing overcome, second law
thermodynamics. fair, equation really represents fact think aging
loss information way xerox something, thousand
times lose information try copy cassette tape. even send
information across internet, will get lost. think aging.
two types information body. genetic information,
digital. ATCG chemical letters DNA, part information
body. just important, essential, fact, systems
control genes switched off cell time response
eat, et cetera. turns 80% future longevity health
controlled second part, epigenetic information, control systems. liken
DNA music DVD compact disc younger people. used
use things. - recall. - Yeah, epigenome reader says,
okay, cell need play set songs cell, play
different set songs. time, aging equivalent scratching, CD
DVD you, not playing right songs cells don't hear
right songs, get messed don't function well.
saying main driver aging. hallmarks largely manifestations
process. - Can go little deeper scratches are.
way DNA packed cell? way spaced?
scratches referring to? - DNA six foot long. join
chromosomes together, get six foot post-sale. enough go
moon back eight times body. wrapped exist inside us,
not just wrapped willy-nilly. not just bundle string, wrapped
carefully ways dictates genes switched off.
developing embryo, cell marks DNA chemicals says, okay,
gene nerve cell. cell will stay nerve cell next hundred years,


lucky. Don't turn skin cell bad. chemicals,
many different types chemicals, one's called methylation. little menthols will
mark songs get played rest life. change
daily. total, saying body controls genome
ability mark DNA compact parts it, silence genes, don't
read genes open others, keep others open stay open.
pattern genes silent open, silent, open, dictates cells type
cells function. scratches disruption that. genes
silent say, gene involved skin. starting come
brain, shouldn't there, see happen vice versa, gene might get shut
off time aging. Cells time, lose structures, lose identity,
forget supposed get diseases. call aging can
measure that. fact, can measure way

00:15:53 Cosmetic Aging

can predict somebody going die based changes
chemicals. - changes, sorts changes underlie outward
body surface manifestations aging, us familiar with, graying
hair, wrinkling skin, drooping face. Walking around New York lately,
amazing me, certain people seem walk looking sidewalk
spine essentially C shape, right? hallmark, will, aging,
us familiar with. sorts DNA scratches associated
that? talking people potentially going look older,
simply live longer? - Well, actually, old look, want
generalize. start centenarian families. families tend live
hundred. 70, still look 50 less. good indicator.
not perfect can like growing Australia accelerate aging
skin. general, look, no one's ever died gray hair,
overall can get sense just ability skin hold up, thin is,
number wrinkles. great paper just came said AI System looking
face

00:17:15 Development Never Stops, Horvath Clock



accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure
clock birth even birth, look animals, massive increase
age, based clock, early life. right, really important point,
accelerated aging first years life, goes linear
towards rest life. another interesting thing brought up,
finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.
causing scratches? Well, know couple things lab, figured
out. One broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts DNA breaks.
x-ray cosmic ray, even go sun get
broken chromosomes accelerates unwinding beautiful DNA loops
mentioned. can actually mouse. can accelerate process
get old mouse, 50% older, bent spine kyphosis. gray hair,
organs old. now can control aging, forwards direction. thing
accelerates aging massive cell damage stress.



00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.

Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory

body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access

stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

use code Huberman get $5 off. now conversation Dr. David
Sinclair. Thank coming. - Thanks here. good see you. -
mate way, toasting 11:00 AM. Unlike podcasts, we, well,
don't drink alcohol, boring way. truly, thanks here, ton
questions you. go way back sense, doesn't mean don't
many, many questions aging, longevity, lifespan, actionable protocols
increase long live, et cetera. just want start off simple
question. not even sure answer to, difference
longevity, anti-aging aging disease? associate
statement, aging disease. - Right? Well, longevity academic way
describe research. Anti-aging kind thing, got bad rap
used whole bunch people don't know talking
about. really don't like term anti-aging, aging disease longevity
perfectly valid ways talk subject. talk aging disease.


started research, disease Harvard Medical School, considered,
something wrong you. rare thing, less 50%
population, definitely disease, people work whole lives try
cure condition. looked up, definition aging says,
well, deterioration health sickness can die it, typically do.
Something sounds pretty much like disease, caveat
half population gets condition, aging, put different bucket. first
all, outrageous, 'cause just totally arbitrary cutoff. think this,
ignoring major 'cause diseases. Aging 80 90% cause
heart disease, Alzheimer's. didn't get old bodies stayed youthful,
not get diseases. actually showing lab is, turn
clock back, tissues, diseases go away. aging problem instead
through, last 200 years, sticking band-aids diseases
already occurred aging late. couple things.
One want slow aging don't get diseases
occur, don't just take bandaid on, reverse age body

00:10:23 Causes Aging? Epigenome

diseases will go away. - clarifies lot me, thank you. Can point
one specific general phenomenon body underlies aging? - Yeah, well,
contentious scientists like come new hypothesis. build
careers. fortunately two thousands, settled eight nine major
causes aging. call hallmarks 'cause causes little bit strong,
eight nine causes, least first time allowed us come around talk
together. put pizza everyone got equal weighting, equal slices.
that, way, trying kill field,
horrible. - Interesting guys work aging trying kill other. -
Yeah, isn't it? Well kill other's careers. Well like think fairly generous,
one kids old guard really didn't like new guard. just came
along 1990s said, free radicals don't much. actually genes called
longevity genes. caused whole ruckus. competition
never happened, Nobel prize this. just led lot
competition. go meetings people shout backstab,


horrible. unfortunately two thousands, rallied around new
map aging causes hallmarks. think one slice
pizza way larger others. can get that, information
cell call epigenome. - Well tell us little bit epigenome,
frame us will, get ways one can adjust epigenome
positive ways. - Yeah, science, like do, reductionist boil
actually ended boiling, aging equation, loss
information due entropy. hard thing overcome, second law
thermodynamics. fair, equation really represents fact think aging
loss information way xerox something, thousand
times lose information try copy cassette tape. even send
information across internet, will get lost. think aging.
two types information body. genetic information,
digital. ATCG chemical letters DNA, part information
body. just important, essential, fact, systems
control genes switched off cell time response
eat, et cetera. turns 80% future longevity health
controlled second part, epigenetic information, control systems. liken
DNA music DVD compact disc younger people. used
use things. - recall. - Yeah, epigenome reader says,
okay, cell need play set songs cell, play
different set songs. time, aging equivalent scratching, CD
DVD you, not playing right songs cells don't hear
right songs, get messed don't function well.
saying main driver aging. hallmarks largely manifestations
process. - Can go little deeper scratches are.
way DNA packed cell? way spaced?
scratches referring to? - DNA six foot long. join
chromosomes together, get six foot post-sale. enough go
moon back eight times body. wrapped exist inside us,
not just wrapped willy-nilly. not just bundle string, wrapped
carefully ways dictates genes switched off.
developing embryo, cell marks DNA chemicals says, okay,
gene nerve cell. cell will stay nerve cell next hundred years,


lucky. Don't turn skin cell bad. chemicals,
many different types chemicals, one's called methylation. little menthols will
mark songs get played rest life. change
daily. total, saying body controls genome
ability mark DNA compact parts it, silence genes, don't
read genes open others, keep others open stay open.
pattern genes silent open, silent, open, dictates cells type
cells function. scratches disruption that. genes
silent say, gene involved skin. starting come
brain, shouldn't there, see happen vice versa, gene might get shut
off time aging. Cells time, lose structures, lose identity,
forget supposed get diseases. call aging can
measure that. fact, can measure way

00:15:53 Cosmetic Aging

can predict somebody going die based changes
chemicals. - changes, sorts changes underlie outward
body surface manifestations aging, us familiar with, graying
hair, wrinkling skin, drooping face. Walking around New York lately,
amazing me, certain people seem walk looking sidewalk
spine essentially C shape, right? hallmark, will, aging,
us familiar with. sorts DNA scratches associated
that? talking people potentially going look older,
simply live longer? - Well, actually, old look, want
generalize. start centenarian families. families tend live
hundred. 70, still look 50 less. good indicator.
not perfect can like growing Australia accelerate aging
skin. general, look, no one's ever died gray hair,
overall can get sense just ability skin hold up, thin is,
number wrinkles. great paper just came said AI System looking
face

00:17:15 Development Never Stops, Horvath Clock



accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure
clock birth even birth, look animals, massive increase
age, based clock, early life. right, really important point,
accelerated aging first years life, goes linear
towards rest life. another interesting thing brought up,
finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.
causing scratches? Well, know couple things lab, figured
out. One broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts DNA breaks.
x-ray cosmic ray, even go sun get
broken chromosomes accelerates unwinding beautiful DNA loops
mentioned. can actually mouse. can accelerate process
get old mouse, 50% older, bent spine kyphosis. gray hair,
organs old. now can control aging, forwards direction. thing
accelerates aging massive cell damage stress.



00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,

concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

started research, disease Harvard Medical School, considered,
something wrong you. rare thing, less 50%
population, definitely disease, people work whole lives try
cure condition. looked up, definition aging says,
well, deterioration health sickness can die it, typically do.
Something sounds pretty much like disease, caveat
half population gets condition, aging, put different bucket. first
all, outrageous, 'cause just totally arbitrary cutoff. think this,
ignoring major 'cause diseases. Aging 80 90% cause
heart disease, Alzheimer's. didn't get old bodies stayed youthful,
not get diseases. actually showing lab is, turn
clock back, tissues, diseases go away. aging problem instead
through, last 200 years, sticking band-aids diseases
already occurred aging late. couple things.
One want slow aging don't get diseases
occur, don't just take bandaid on, reverse age body

00:10:23 Causes Aging? Epigenome

diseases will go away. - clarifies lot me, thank you. Can point
one specific general phenomenon body underlies aging? - Yeah, well,
contentious scientists like come new hypothesis. build
careers. fortunately two thousands, settled eight nine major
causes aging. call hallmarks 'cause causes little bit strong,
eight nine causes, least first time allowed us come around talk
together. put pizza everyone got equal weighting, equal slices.
that, way, trying kill field,
horrible. - Interesting guys work aging trying kill other. -
Yeah, isn't it? Well kill other's careers. Well like think fairly generous,
one kids old guard really didn't like new guard. just came
along 1990s said, free radicals don't much. actually genes called
longevity genes. caused whole ruckus. competition
never happened, Nobel prize this. just led lot
competition. go meetings people shout backstab,


horrible. unfortunately two thousands, rallied around new
map aging causes hallmarks. think one slice
pizza way larger others. can get that, information
cell call epigenome. - Well tell us little bit epigenome,
frame us will, get ways one can adjust epigenome
positive ways. - Yeah, science, like do, reductionist boil
actually ended boiling, aging equation, loss
information due entropy. hard thing overcome, second law
thermodynamics. fair, equation really represents fact think aging
loss information way xerox something, thousand
times lose information try copy cassette tape. even send
information across internet, will get lost. think aging.
two types information body. genetic information,
digital. ATCG chemical letters DNA, part information
body. just important, essential, fact, systems
control genes switched off cell time response
eat, et cetera. turns 80% future longevity health
controlled second part, epigenetic information, control systems. liken
DNA music DVD compact disc younger people. used
use things. - recall. - Yeah, epigenome reader says,
okay, cell need play set songs cell, play
different set songs. time, aging equivalent scratching, CD
DVD you, not playing right songs cells don't hear
right songs, get messed don't function well.
saying main driver aging. hallmarks largely manifestations
process. - Can go little deeper scratches are.
way DNA packed cell? way spaced?
scratches referring to? - DNA six foot long. join
chromosomes together, get six foot post-sale. enough go
moon back eight times body. wrapped exist inside us,
not just wrapped willy-nilly. not just bundle string, wrapped
carefully ways dictates genes switched off.
developing embryo, cell marks DNA chemicals says, okay,
gene nerve cell. cell will stay nerve cell next hundred years,


lucky. Don't turn skin cell bad. chemicals,
many different types chemicals, one's called methylation. little menthols will
mark songs get played rest life. change
daily. total, saying body controls genome
ability mark DNA compact parts it, silence genes, don't
read genes open others, keep others open stay open.
pattern genes silent open, silent, open, dictates cells type
cells function. scratches disruption that. genes
silent say, gene involved skin. starting come
brain, shouldn't there, see happen vice versa, gene might get shut
off time aging. Cells time, lose structures, lose identity,
forget supposed get diseases. call aging can
measure that. fact, can measure way

00:15:53 Cosmetic Aging

can predict somebody going die based changes
chemicals. - changes, sorts changes underlie outward
body surface manifestations aging, us familiar with, graying
hair, wrinkling skin, drooping face. Walking around New York lately,
amazing me, certain people seem walk looking sidewalk
spine essentially C shape, right? hallmark, will, aging,
us familiar with. sorts DNA scratches associated
that? talking people potentially going look older,
simply live longer? - Well, actually, old look, want
generalize. start centenarian families. families tend live
hundred. 70, still look 50 less. good indicator.
not perfect can like growing Australia accelerate aging
skin. general, look, no one's ever died gray hair,
overall can get sense just ability skin hold up, thin is,
number wrinkles. great paper just came said AI System looking
face

00:17:15 Development Never Stops, Horvath Clock



accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure
clock birth even birth, look animals, massive increase
age, based clock, early life. right, really important point,
accelerated aging first years life, goes linear
towards rest life. another interesting thing brought up,
finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.
causing scratches? Well, know couple things lab, figured
out. One broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts DNA breaks.
x-ray cosmic ray, even go sun get
broken chromosomes accelerates unwinding beautiful DNA loops
mentioned. can actually mouse. can accelerate process
get old mouse, 50% older, bent spine kyphosis. gray hair,
organs old. now can control aging, forwards direction. thing
accelerates aging massive cell damage stress.



00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

00:15:53 Cosmetic Aging

can predict somebody going die based changes
chemicals. - changes, sorts changes underlie outward
body surface manifestations aging, us familiar with, graying
hair, wrinkling skin, drooping face. Walking around New York lately,
amazing me, certain people seem walk looking sidewalk
spine essentially C shape, right? hallmark, will, aging,
us familiar with. sorts DNA scratches associated
that? talking people potentially going look older,
simply live longer? - Well, actually, old look, want
generalize. start centenarian families. families tend live
hundred. 70, still look 50 less. good indicator.
not perfect can like growing Australia accelerate aging
skin. general, look, no one's ever died gray hair,
overall can get sense just ability skin hold up, thin is,
number wrinkles. great paper just came said AI System looking
face

00:17:15 Development Never Stops, Horvath Clock



accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure
clock birth even birth, look animals, massive increase
age, based clock, early life. right, really important point,
accelerated aging first years life, goes linear
towards rest life. another interesting thing brought up,
finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.
causing scratches? Well, know couple things lab, figured
out. One broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts DNA breaks.

00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.

Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory

body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,

right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay

shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

00:15:53 Cosmetic Aging

can predict somebody going die based changes
chemicals. - changes, sorts changes underlie outward
body surface manifestations aging, us familiar with, graying
hair, wrinkling skin, drooping face. Walking around New York lately,
amazing me, certain people seem walk looking sidewalk
spine essentially C shape, right? hallmark, will, aging,
us familiar with. sorts DNA scratches associated
that? talking people potentially going look older,
simply live longer? - Well, actually, old look, want

face

00:17:15 Development Never Stops, Horvath Clock



accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure

finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.

00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

accurately predict someone's age. - interesting. started off
developmental neurobiology. one things learned early still
believe wholeheartedly development doesn't stop age 12 15 even 25
entire life one long developmental arc. thinking different portions
developmental arc, early portion infancy, especially puberty, seem like
especially rapid stages aging. know normally look babies children
kids puberty, think, oh, vital, young. yet way
describe changes epigenome way framed aging
disease leads ask periods immense vitality, periods
aging faster. - Yes, yes. something never talked about, least not
publicly. really good question. chemicals can measure, also
known Horvath's clock. biological clock, separate
chronological age. actually didn't mention AI looked
faces people, predict biological age, internal age.
skin represents age organs well. people look
themselves, can talk later. people
10, 20 years younger people biologically turns measure
clock birth even birth, look animals, massive increase
age, based clock, early life. right, really important point,
accelerated aging first years life, goes linear
towards rest life. another interesting thing brought up,
finding genes get messed up, get scratched
leading aging early developmental genes. come late life just
mess system seem particularly susceptible scratches.
causing scratches? Well, know couple things lab, figured
out. One broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts DNA breaks.
x-ray cosmic ray, even go sun get
broken chromosomes accelerates unwinding beautiful DNA loops
mentioned. can actually mouse. can accelerate process
get old mouse, 50% older, bent spine kyphosis. gray hair,
organs old. now can control aging, forwards direction. thing
accelerates aging massive cell damage stress.



00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes

sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003

caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

00:20:12 Puberty Rate Determinant Aging Rate

pinched nerves saw aging process accelerated well. -
Incredible, anecdotal phenomenon. anecdotal phenomenon,
experience junior high school, going home summer come
back high school US usually starts eighth ninth grade, grade eight
grade nine Canadians. kids, like grew beards
summer, completely matured quickly summer. think
reason believe rates entry puberty can predict overall
rates aging? words, kid slow burner, right? basically acquire
traits puberty slowly many years. Can make course prediction
going live long time versus kid goes home summer comes
back completely different organism appearing completely different organism.
Like basically age quickly summer. mean aging
quickly overall? - Well, yeah, don't want scare anybody. - Sure. -
studies show slower take develop also predictive
longer, healthier life. may something growth hormone. know
growth hormone pro-aging. Anyone taking growth hormone, pay attention. -
Just look someone taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - often will acquire
characteristics vitality, like improved smoothness skin, whole body
shape changes often. - Yeah, mean feel better short amount time.
build muscle, feel great, like burning candle ends. Ultimately,
want live longer, want less that. animals
generated mutants low growth hormone, sometimes dwarfs,
live longest far. guy lab, Michael Bankowski, longest lived
mouse, mouse typically lives two bit years. mouse lived five
years gave chloric restriction, fasting, combined one dwarf
mutations, low growth hormone, think called Yoda. look lives
longest, really small people. bit anecdotal, sounds like might
true, people played munchkins Wizard Oz, many
went live nineties beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. -
Lauren dwarfs well? dwarf mutations South America
seem protected many diseases aging. barely ever
see heart disease



00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

00:23:00 Fasting, Hunger & Food Choices

cancer families. - owned large dog breed, bulldog Mastiff
lived long life bulldog, 11 years, many dogs will live 12, 16
years smaller dogs. Can say direct relationship body
size longevity duration life? - Well, is, doesn't mean
slave early epigenome genome. good news
epigenome can change. loops structures can modified live
life. born tall wasn't, wished time grow,
no matter size are, can bigger impact life anything
genes give you. 80% epigenetic not genetic. - talk
things people can do. kind batch categories rather just
diving right actionable protocols. first one relates food, blood sugar, insulin.
something hear lot about, fasting good us, rarely hear
good us. One reasons excited talk today want
drill details think understanding mechanism will allow
people make better choices not simply just decide whether not going
fast not fast, long going fast, think dictated
someone understanding mechanism. elevated blood
sugar, glucose insulin ages us quickly periods
time day perhaps longer can extend lifespan? - Well, start
think big mistake idea people never hungry. live
world now least three meals day, got companies
selling bars snacks between. feeling hunger, people never
experienced hunger whole lives. really, really bad them. based,
believe 20th century view don't want stress pancreas
try keep insulin levels pretty steady not fluctuation. actually
found, colleagues I, across field longevity look first
animals, whether dog mouse monkey, ones live longest
far 30% longer stay healthy ones don't eat time actually first
discovered back early 20th century, people ignored it.
rediscovered 1930s, Claude McKay Clark restriction. put cellulose
food rats, couldn't get many calories even though ate. rats


lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

lived 30% longer, went away came back 2000's big way,
couple things happened, one lab others showed
longevity genes body come protect us aging disease.
group genes work called sirtuins seven them.
show 2005 science paper, low levels insulin another
molecule called insulin like growth factor, low levels turn longevity genes.
One really important called SIRT1. high levels insulin
day, fed, means longevity genes not switched on. falling
apart, epigenome, information, keeps cells functioning time, just
degrades quick. clock ticking faster always fed. Okay. thing
think might happening always food around not allowing
cell periods rest re-establish epigenome. also accelerating
direction. plenty reasons well, not profound,
low levels glucose body will trigger major muscles brain
become sensitive insulin suck glucose bloodstream,
good. don't want glucose flowing around much, will ward
off type two diabetes. - hunger course associated low blood glucose
low insulin. think anything subjective experience hunger
beneficial longevity? - Yeah, do, though get used feeling
not eating, kind screwed way. - like cold water, eventually adapt. -
get used it, unfortunately, studies done
National Institutes Health able simulate effect hunger, still
provide calories. looking like small component due hunger,
it, actually, got periods not fed
body turns defensive genes. really interesting experiment
published maybe couple years ago Rafael de Cabo NIH.
took 10,000 mice gave different combinations fat,
carbohydrate, protein. trying figure best combination.
also cleverly group. Well, two groups, one fed time
ate much wanted group given food hour
day. turns ate roughly amount calories, 'cause course
hour stuffing faces. turns didn't matter diet gave them,
group ate within window lived longer dramatically longer.
conclusion is, mice similar us, metabolically, think tells us


not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

not important, eat, eat day. -
protocol people can extrapolate that? maybe just ask you,
protocol eat avoid food? fast, ever fast,
longer 24 hours? do? think good jumping off
place people want explore protocol? - Well, one thing say,
say definitely try skip meal day, best thing. - matter
meal essentially equivalent? - Well, long end beginning
day, add sleep period hopefully not
eating. - think excellent point. realized simple one, think
excellent one 'cause think one things people struggle
knowing initiate so-called intermittent fasting. middle
day obviously not tacked sleep cycle way. much
harder well many people. - Yeah, well, tell do. skip breakfast,
tiny bit yogurt olive oil supplements need dissolved it.
go throughout whole day, right now, glass
water here, just keeping filled liquids. don't feel hungry,
aware first two three weeks, try will feel hungry
also habit wanting just chew something lot physical parts
it, try make first three weeks without breakfast
without dinner get it. life, actually,
mainly wasn't hungry morning. people hungry
morning may want consider skipping dinner instead, will go throughout
whole day. don't get crashes high glucose low glucose
anyone goes, oh man, three O'clock, going need sleep.
do, will not experience anymore body regulates
blood sugar levels naturally. liver putting glucose needs to,
steady gives pure focus throughout day. don't even
think lunch, just powering through. dinner, mean, love food much
anybody. will eat regular, pretty healthy meal. try eat mostly vegetables,
can eat fish, shrimp, rarely will eat steak. fact, microbiome
adapted diet now, eat steak, will not get digested well. feel terrible. -
don't eat steak, feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, can talk
time. - Well, everybody's different, thing.
works may not perfect measure things know


working. rarely eat dessert, gave dessert sugar turned 40
occasionally steal bit dessert 'cause doesn't hurt steal it, right.?
avoid sugar, includes simple carbohydrates, bread, try avoid,
actually noticed, just side note. used get buildup plaque pretty easily
every time went dentist, scrape off. even bought tools
scrape off. 'cause driving nuts. don't get pluck anymore think
diet. don't sugars mouth bacteria feed
form biofilm teeth. Much better breath, way. - benefit.
ever fast longer this. sounds go bed, well, used tend
stay late. know get texts

00:32:44 Fasting Schedules, Long Fasts, (Macro)Autophagy

like two morning time, means late early
well. assuming people go sleep sometime around 1130 12, plus minus
hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

hour wake sometime around 7:00 plus minus 90 minutes, eating
less on. sounds something like 20 hours fasting, four hours eating 16
hours fasting eight hours food intake, et cetera. ever longer fast,
like 48 hours 72 hours week long, fast? - Occasionally do. typical day
eat within two hour window. Just usually either eating or. - 'Cause
22 too. - Yeah, love well. - exercise, feel like you,
just power maintain fasted state? - Absolutely, can exercise now
already used it. don't feel like need food exercising, used to.
gone longer? Yes, not often. find quite difficult go 24 hours.
it, maybe month, go two days two actually even
better, go three days without eating, kicks even greater longevity benefits.
system called autophagy system, digests old misfolded
proteins body. natural cleansing happens hungry.
Macroautophagy name good friend mine, Ana Maria Cuervo Albert
Einstein College Medicine discovered deep cleanse called chaperone mediated
autophagy, kicks day two, day three, really gets rid deep proteins.
excites just put big paper said, trigger process
old mouse, lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, big deal.
go longer, would. just find lifestyle going always day, 110%


need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible
physical stature, lean, strong vital at, wouldn't say advanced
age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking
testosterone estrogen, probably say. women take hormone
therapies later life take estrogen, experience strong increase vitality
done correctly, effect aging, body rapidly, sort
second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances
podcasts,

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

need eat least day unfortunately. - One practical question
mechanistic question

00:34:50 Caffeine, Electrolytes

related this, practical question fasting, regardless long,
know ingesting fluids like water presumably caffeine heard
several espresso today, impressive, also ingesting
electrolytes? Like know people get lightheaded, start feel shaky
fast. addition sodium water potassium magnesium
something becoming little invoke now. something
see need people do? - Well, makes sense, haven't need
it. don't, drink tea day coffee first awake don't get
shakes. don't fix not broken. add things protocol
think will improve avoid things course wont. yeah,
don't need it, don't try it. make sense, especially
big night night before, probably want supplement that.

00:35:56 Blood Glucose & Sirtuins; mTOR

think fair amount good stuff tea coffee is. - Okay,
mechanistic question is, told us ample evidence keeping
blood sugar low period time 24 hours, can help trigger pro
longevity anti-aging mechanisms. extending two three days can
trigger yet additional mechanisms gobbling dead cells things sort.
blood glucose triggers mechanisms? said, okay,
remove glucose things get better. talked maybe talk
now underlying cellar genetic mechanisms, things like
sirtuins, glucose sirtuins actually tethered one another
mechanistically. - really good question, proves scientist
world-leading one. now know longevity pathways, call
longevity genes, talk other. used say, oh, longevity
genes important yours. ridiculous. 'Cause talking
other, pull one lever one moves. way think


systems set detect eating. sirtuins will mainly respond
sugar insulin. system called mTOR, sensing
much protein amino acids coming body. talk other,
can pull one affect vice versa. together fasting,
get sirtuin activation, good you. also lack amino
acids, particularly three them, leucine, lysine valine. body will down-regulate
mTOR sirtuin, MTOR hugely beneficial turns
body's defenses, pro chewing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,
giving us energy, repairing cells, that.

00:37:55 Amino Acids: Leucine, “Pulsing”

two pathways, think, important longevity. - interesting,
mentioned leucine, within resistance training slash body building slash fitness
community. Leucine gets lot attention long-standing debates
much protein one needs per day much want can assimilate
meal. makes many YouTube videos not much else, frankly. However,
clear leucine's effects mTOR pathway, many
people, not just people particular fitness communities actively trying
ingest leucine regular basis order maximize wellness fitness
cases muscle growth also just wellness. interpret last
statement mean leucine, triggers seller growth actually pro aging
sense, right? - Well, evidence suggests.
goes back debate. supplement growth hormone
testosterone? activities will give immediate benefits. bulk more.
feel better immediately, based research, expense long-term
health. view longevity, way treat body don't burn candles.
one end candle lit, careful don't blow it, also enough
exercise building muscle, not huge. Anyone seen me,
knows not professional bodybuilder, tried actually, key.
haven't said publicly, can remember. pulse things get periods
fasting eat, take supplement, fast, exercise
taking supplements eating right timing allow build muscle
sometimes can't just expect take something constantly


something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible

age, getting just seems getting better better. Ori
Hofmekler person essentially founded, will, although ancestors
founded, completely fair, so-called intermittent fasting diet. called
warrior diet book didn't get much attention. one things just
said really reminded Ori. sat him, actually went home sat
said, fasting wonderful pulses nourish
body even slightly nourish body provided aren't frequent,
tremendous effect vitality. want use kind segue address
issue vitality versus longevity, telling certainly
evidence supports growth hormone will make feel better younger taking

second puberty will, idea restriction pulsing, not necessarily
feast famine, certainly famine feast lowercase letters, really seems
something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise
day, will skip Metformin. lot people pay attention kind


thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,
either press release reporter will say, oh goodness, big difference, 5%
contact Metformin exercise. headline. go
barely significant. graph distorted changed axes make
look bigger. now become myth Metformin greatly inhibits ability
exercise, not true, abundance caution, skipped Metformin
days going exercise. not that, one 20% people
stomach sensitivity it. not feeling great day, don't take either. -
mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age

transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription

Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.

one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access

stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible

people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest

mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel

thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work

body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached

follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

something constantly work. taken 15 years
develop protocol. lot subtlety it. - Yeah, sounds like
rational protocol. name Ori Hofmekler mean anything you? - No. - Okay, just
briefly, discovered Ori Hofmekler 15 years ago, Israeli special forces.
now got close 70. Forgive Ori, number inflated. wrote
book called 'The Warrior Diet', got little attention time. said
Israeli special forces, rarely ate per day.
sometimes every second third day. guy maintains incredible

something that. cellular level, kind go back mTOR
sirtuins. think cells might reacting kind lowercased feast
upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, pulsing, think want
get cells perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause modern life
sitting around, eating much, not exercising. cells respond. go,
hey, everything's cool, no problem. become relaxed turn
defenses age rapidly. can see clock. People exercise eat
less, slower ticking clock, fact. protocol different
people's pulsing it. Now, first all, get to, even think
might possible? 'Cause didn't read warrior diet. found research


gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest
day give nutritious dinner body give rest,
exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise

Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina

Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation

mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't

kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,

not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know

talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

gave resveratrol red wine molecule, became well known
2000's. gave mice, whole lifespan, protected high-fat
diet, call Western diet. lean organs. live slightly longer,
not lot. gave high-fat diet without resveratrol, actually lived lot
shorter. resveratrol protected high-fat diet. gave
normal diet, just ate wanted, wasn't much effect.
not known though supplemental data paper nobody ever reads.
mice given resveratrol every second day normal diet live dramatically
longer group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - people there, critics say,
resveratrol didn't extend lifespan mice normal diet. Therefore not aging,
just protecting high-fat diet. Well, look supplemental data, please.
give mice every day, mice living three years. - Wow,
long time, got many, many mice owner ownership lab
Stanford long life mouse.

00:44:35 Metformin, Berberine

- was, far. long life span extension. told
probably, don't want taking supplement every day. can take either
every day give body rest. meals, rest

exercise. try time times taking drug
Metformin, mimics low energy. don't know, Metformin
drug given type two diabetics bring blood sugar levels.
found looking tens thousands veterans those, two type two
diabetics live longer people don't even get type two diabetes. longevity
drug, right now get doctor US, countries
can just get counter protected. looks like, based epidemiological
data, cancer, heart disease LT. else? Dementia. take Metformin. -
addition, take Metformin end fast fasting day. take relative
fasting? - Yeah, always take Metformin morning, along resveratrol,
number reasons, mainly body responds better
measuring body 12, 13 years. thing, going exercise

thing, think stop taking Metformin 'cause never going get
muscle, going affect ability build muscle. not true,
Metformin you, actually just reduces ability stamina
inhibiting body's ability make energy. happens
Metformin, fewer reps. guess what? muscles build
Metformin, strength much lower inflammation
markers aging. just won't extra 5% size muscles. want large
muscles, don't take Metformin fine exercise. me, not
trying get giant. want strong muscles want live longer healthier. just
try time get reps exercise regime, sometimes
scientific literature, worth bringing up. 5% difference graph,

mentioned Metformin available prescription doctor, least US.
Berberine substance comes Tree Barco. also learned many years
ago Ori. said, ever, going overeat like Thanksgiving meal
something, take berberine, words. tried remarkable
berberine can eat enormous quantities food not feel
eaten enormous quantities food. not necessarily recommending people this.
noticed took berberine, understanding works
similarly Metformin AMPK pathway mTOR pathway, et
cetera, didn't ingest food particular carbohydrates, feel little dizzy
kind get headache, like almost hypoglycemic. thoughts berberine
alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

alternative Metformin? cautionary notes? Obviously people
talk doctor adding subtracting anything life, including
breath order, anything comes up, set aside,
thoughts berberine timing low blood sugar sorts things? -
Right, well, access Metformin, taking berberine. often known
poor man's Metformin. - just called poor. - Women can take too.


thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess

actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

thing berberine started lab, effective boosting energetics
body, just like AMPK Metformin does. actually given rats
mice seen healthy, especially high-fat diet. think
likely good. human studies exist, clinical trials showing
increases insulin sensitivity. take high doses. - good thing, right?
think people hear insulin sensitivity, sometimes people think, oh, well bad,
right? No, want cells insulin sensitive. don't want lot blood
sugar floating around can't sequestered cells. - Exactly, anti type
two diabetes. berberine wonderful effects metabolism
animals clinical trials dozens people tested. Now,
one cautionary tale, just came up, Caenorhabditis lab published
berberine reduced lifespan worms, not sure worms trump human clinical
trials point. - Not opinion, no disrespect C. elegans colleagues
rather colleagues work C. - Yeah, well, like give
information, people can decide want, say based worm data,
wouldn't panic just yet.

00:50:29 Resveratrol, Wine

think berberine shown really safe humans. - mentioned
resveratrol, think now great time talk little bit about, protocols
resveratrol, great seed extract, et cetera. start obvious one know
get lot, record, can't just drink red wine get enough resveratrol, David.
- can try, need drink 200 glasses day. - sure tried. -
some, drink glass red wine day get chance,
that, lot calories liver will get fatty bad. So, mean,
realistically, can get thousand milligrams take day
supplement pure. Now lot people selling resveratrol. not light
gray white color, throw away. brown stuff gone bad contaminated.
contaminated stuff beware it'll cause diarrhea. regular resveratrol not
that. - thousand milligrams per day do. - Yeah
15 years now. ingest fatty substance, like olive oil yogurt,
right? - Yeah, to, supplements course curcumin.
crunchy things, not going get gut. not just making


up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable

saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

up. always base statements human studies. done lot studies
resveratrol others since, know from, found early, one
first people take high dose resveratrol. included food,
levels blood went five fold. want something there.
just drink water, not going get through. unfortunately, people
done clinical trials without even thinking might need dissolve
something. - taking morning chasing
olive oil dissolving yogurt? specific protocol? - Yeah,
improving perfecting 10 years take Greek yogurt,
couple spoonfuls, put resveratrol there, mix around, make sure dissolved
put mouth swallow that, days, like do,
realized olive oil particularly oleic acid, one mono unsaturated, fatty acids
also activator sirtuin defenses. trying ingest oleic acid.
switched olive oil. put couple teaspoons olive oil glass mix
around resveratrol, maybe Coresatin similar molecule. Make sure
dissolved. put little bit vinegar basil leaf, put in.

00:53:20 Breaks Fast?

like drinking salad dressing. very- - Delicious, raises
question want ask get NMN NR vitamin B3,
that, think breaks fast? want just frame question
breaking fast general scientific theme. love thoughts this.
One questions get asked time ingesting blank break fast,
eating drinking this, coffee? walk room someone else eating
cracker, break fast? People get pretty extreme this, sense please
tell wrong, sense depends context
night before, whether not diabetic, lots things. instance, eat
enormous meal midnight, go sleep, wake 6:00 AM. imagine black
coffee coffee little bit cream might quote unquote, break fast,
body doesn't breaking fast switch. body speaks language
glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. worry ingesting calories going
quote unquote break fast? generally, think issue
whether not fasting enough get positive effects? not


everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

everybody can manage just water just tea, say not everybody
willing manage just water just tea certain part day. - Well, first
answer not scientific, philosophical. don't enjoy life, point.
like cup coffee morning, little bit milk, spoonful yogurt, not going
kill me. Olive oil doesn't protein carbs it, not many. probably not
affecting longevity pathways negatively, without that, first all, wouldn't
enjoy life much. Second, well, olive oil isn't not great yogurt,
trying optimize no perfect solution doing. still
learning. don't know optimal me, let alone everybody else.
you, don't believe taking couple spoonfuls something, unless high
fructose corn syrup going hurt now got rest day till
eight, 9:00 PM not eating anything. forgive that.
really good point here. discussing earlier. point
try best. go regular living donate whole day,
going fail. like quitting smoking, cold turkey. easy chew gum stick
patch body get used sorts habits. social,
physical, putting stuff mouth, chewing, not just low blood sugar levels
brain will fight it. limbic system going go, hey, it, it, it.
going fight get it, better,
stages. breakfast first, small lunch eventually cut lunch out. Don't
go cold turkey everyone knows. fact try strict diet right
gates, almost always fail. - Now, think captures essence

00:56:45 Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing

fasting rationally irrational approach supplementation well, along
lines supplementation. NMN, NR B3, niacin? one, want
know do. also want know do, think people want
know do. molecules impact sirtuin pathway impact
pathways control aging rates aging epigenome.
that? one incorporate supplementation protocol?
choose that? right. - Well, disclaimer don't recommend anything, talk
do. bit scientific background, two genes
discovered first yeast cells MIT animals moved


Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

Harvard 2000's one first post-docs, actually literally first postdoc Haim
Cohen, published great paper just couple months ago found turning
sirtuin six gene, middle seven, number six gene potent. extended
lifespan dramatically mice engineered males females, great.
want naturally boost activity sirtuins.
genes, also make proteins. genes typically make encode.
proteins take care body many different ways discussed.
turn genes make proteins make even active?
want rev system. exercise will it, fasting will it.
supplementation? Well, first activator sirtuins discovered acts
enzyme make better job cleaning body protecting resveratrol
looked thousands different molecules, eventually tens thousands.
one best resveratrol dish. gave little organisms,
worms, flies mice, eventually humans. saw activated
enzyme. resveratrol one way activate it. can think
accelerator pedal car. revs up, something else sirtuins need
work NAD really small molecule, little chemical body
need life. used body chemical reactions, hundred different
reactions body. without it, dead within seconds, need NAD.
problem seen NAD levels decline become obese, get
older, don't ever get hungry body not doesn't make enough it,
chewing well. enzyme called CD38 Eric Verdin UCSF
showed choose up. Now now Buck Institute California, choose NAD
get older. double whammy. don't make much chew up,
really bad shown lab others NAD levels
really important keeping sirtuins defenses useful level.
can give lot resveratrol don't fuel, basically accelerating
car doesn't enough gas. want both. do. take
precursor NAD called NMN body uses make NAD molecule one
step. know measuring dozens human beings, take NMN
time period do, taking years. take two
weeks, double average, double NAD levels blood. Okay, not
public information. clinical trials not yet published last two
years. ways increase NAD levels someone like me, getting


older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age

transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory

mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

older, 52 now. can take NR, used make amend, used
make NAD, NMN NR sold companies US. NR laxter
phosphate, phosphate small chemical body needs. probably heard
atom, phosphorus. go back one step. make NR? NR gets made
vitamin B3, often. can also find milk foods, sometimes
people ask me, don't just take vitamin B3? won't just force body
make NAD? answer no, doesn't work well. know just
experiment, reason think NAD, said, small molecule,
relative vitamin B3, big. got phosphates there, got sugar, got
vitamin B attached. got components come together make
complicated little molecule called NAD. give NMN, contains
three components body needs make NAD. give NR just vitamin B3,
even smaller molecule, body find components
somewhere else. get phosphate, well, body needs DNA,
needs bones. high doses something requires additional phosphate
makes little concerned. compared NMN NR head-to-head
mouse studies, instance NMN, shown cell paper years ago,
makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% 'cause better blood flow,
better energy. NR dose, not that. fact, no effect. - see,
dosage wise, elect take NMN supplement form increase NAD levels
presumably slow aging, much NMN take? protocol
do? various forms there, better worse? -
Well, always happy tell father does, 82-year-old
father, take gram NMN every day. - gram resveratrol gram
NMN. - Right. - Okay thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, is,
not everybody else. different microbiome, age, sex, right?
measuring know something's, think know something's
making better worse based measuring 45 different things. just want people
aware may not perfectly work others, studied,
said, dozens people take NMN, gram, sometimes two grams.
know looking people without exceptions, do,
NAD levels go two fold more. every day,
thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now never get brands that. First
all, don't time measure products. don't know, though say,


want say working solution people know works real
isn't, not yet. meantime, say, want buy
this, say want buy NMN, look company well-established
high levels quality control. Look three letters, GMP, good manufacturing
practices. means make certain level quality control.
not going find iron filings probably stuff say
does. can say right now. working something going
much helpful, overall, make sure white, crystalline NMN, me,
tastes like burnt popcorn. - crack open capsules, take little sample
make sure tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, making capsules, taste
lot quality control stuff take. - take gram
resveratrol take spread throughout day? -
morning things. take Metformin, NMN resveratrol altogether.
good reason that. scientific, try be. levels NAD go
morning bodies naturally. bodies actually cycle NAD, not
steady. - Arcadian? - Acadian. fact, NAD controls clock. shown
Shin Imai colleagues nice science paper decade ago,
disrupt NAD cycle, controlled sirtuin gene worked on,
telling body, oh, time eat, time go sleep. take these,
NMN late night, example, can disrupt circadian rhythms. - Interesting.
- Conversely, travel want reset clock time zone, will take
boost NMN morning feel great. - protocol you,
produce immediate effects increased energy, et cetera? mentioned one
would, right them, take least two weeks start see
NAD levels increase. point, NAD levels increase, one possibly expect
increase overall energy, focus, et cetera? realize not making promises here,
just wondering whether not measure whether not protocol
working whether not die age blank blank plus 20. course,
dead, can't really know would've lived longer done something
differently vice versa. - Sure, well, study Shin Imai good
friend Washington University St. Louis showed improves, remember
insulin sensitivity, good thing. can't know insulin sensitivity
unless measuring glucose, glucose monitor arm. -
one right now? - No, no, used to, learned lot. - Yeah, last time saw


thing, looks like small leach, not large leach measuring blood
glucose. - informative learn body reacts
grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate
effects energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - feel, question.
anecdotally, 'cause taking long time, don't take it, start feel
50 years old, horrible. can't think straight. may placebo, knows?
now careful clinical trials. done safety two years,
now treating elderly patients Harvard Medical School wonderful
colleagues. people actually going currently MRIs. can
measure energetics NAD levels legs exercise real time.
will tell us see mice increased endurance actually works.
meantime, fun talk anecdotes. number athlete friends,
increased load, time marathons, example. good
friend circle winning marathons age 50 now. attributes
protocol on. - Interesting, haven't started taking NMN,
planning next birthday arrives, couple months.
experiments sister years, sister three years older
am, enthusiastic protocols. tell reading
book, started purchasing giving NMN supplement
claims believe her. quite sensitive system tuned it.
feels far away better takes it, opposed doesn't
done control experiment removing supply, giving back
kind thing.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

grapes really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees that, issue was, what,
we, Andrew? - issue whether not can expect immediate

01:09:10 Artificial Sweeteners Bad Us?

laboratory. younger brothers older sisters.
question something no relevance, can just treat
speed bump move right on. artificial sweeteners, things
say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. got Stevia, plant
basically. got sucralose aspartame things.
evidence know aware of, publishing quite reputable
journals, showing can disrupt gut microbiome certain cases particular


saccharin, one basically nobody uses anymore. questionable
whether not Stevia negative effects, et cetera. not
about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required
post credentials alongside name, [chuckles] people take
articles into, additional grain salt, right? mean, words, think
science media mainly generated around two specific goals. One make people
very, afraid get people very, excited, oftentimes get people excited
part sponsored content,

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

about, terms sensation of, perception sweet taste,
possible detriment pro-longevity, forgive using term, pathways.
drink diet coke fast, somehow disrupting this? asking
question, get asked question lot. - Well, may small effects.
don't think worth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed 'cause
drinking diet coke first interview them. will drink diet coke,
read scientific literature. again, 5% thing think blowing
proportion. put number it, say, eating high sugary meal
drinking sugar-filled soda, that, 30 grams sugar? say 10
10 bad you. diet coke might one. I'm, going do?
10 one go without life. one occasion. try avoid
don't like ones much. can't say sucralose equivalent
drinking sugary soda. just no comparison. think suc, it? Stevia,
use Stevia whenever can, naturally sourced product. haven't
seen good evidence yet bad you. think lot overblown,
lot media trying give equal weight stories know
scientist. can frustrating something's 10 something's one,
equated. - say respectfully? think science journalists required

01:12:04 Iron Load & Aging

think overlooked case. Thank that. want talk iron
iron load. talking earlier ferritin. course, women menstruate.
iron needs greater people, men don't menstruate women
don't menstruate. don't think can get right much iron somebody
needs it'll vary person person. surprised learn iron
actually going accelerate aging process various contexts. - Well, new


finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances
podcasts,

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

finding Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab found excess iron will increase
number senescent cells body. senescent cells zombie cells
accumulate get older sit cause inflammation mainly
also can cause cancer. found get rid cells never
accumulate them, stay younger. animals, really interesting
studies Mayo Clinic humans well. iron pro-senescent metal.
think taking excess iron supplement, probably
accelerating aging process. thing found really interesting
looked hundreds thousands people's metabolism blood biomarkers.
one first people InsideTracker board member, still
scientific lead guy. can look anonymously hundreds thousands people's
blood work. also know fit are, old are.
marathon runners, CrossFit. signature health
actually different average person. Now, not going say bad things
MDs 'cause lot best friends MDs work Harvard
Medical School. issue though, MD training, scale
normal, normal range, something must wrong,
paradigm work under. first all, everybody's different, want
know baseline track people years know normal them.
find example, people really healthy live way
diet fairly vegetarian, not strict, still slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly
low iron, slightly low ferritin, super amounts energy, not anemic.
getting along great life. doctor just looks might say, oh,
need give iron. right, getting example of, need
personalize medicine look people long run know works
healthy them,

01:15:05 Blood Work Analysis

not just work towards average human, work towards optimal
human. - love answer. mentioned tracking tracking time.
really interesting area know focused long time.
getting blood worked every six months frankly, since college. just got,
like data got interested supplementation exercise 'cause made feel


better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances
podcasts,

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

better, also want know going hood. get numbers
back, get hormone, hormone, blood glucose measure, et cetera.
make sense data? mean, InsideTracker aside,
personally make sense data ways might differ way standard
MD might look one charts? standard practice say, red,
yellow, green, right? basically high low? somewhere close
margins okay? ranges? things pay
attention think particularly interesting people just take note of?
mean, not asking go anybody's physician. sorts things
people start educate terms molecules
charts choose get them, look at? - Yeah, well,
lot there. first tracking things, one measurement
isn't enough. things vary time. can decade
data, super important, informative, know, well know, know.
physician, interestingly, physician, take example. sees me,
says, "How feeling?" "I'm feeling great." "Okay, see next year,"
craziness. Anyway, say, okay, stop. talk little bit about. - Let educate you,
David tells physician. imagine 12-year-old David Sinclair says
physician, "Listen, different discussion." works? - is.
finds pretty annoying dentist. say, hang on, got data.
got InsideTracker data. pull screen, showing
changes cholesterol CRP, inflammatory marker know.
going it, can see things change time, corrected
go slightly optimal range me, different
do, course. funny says, great, love data.
not allowed get course, insurance companies won't pay
it. again, can pay pocket. not super expensive. say, save
bit money coffee, can afford kind stuff. main point
doctors like data. just unable spend money every one
patients get it. - code word someone can use physician
will trigger comprehensive blood test? keep trying figure code
one needs ask tell doctor, feeling blank get full blood
panel. - Well. - hemorrhaging gut something? - Well,
usually use WTH method, hell? says, "Okay,


it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak

sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

it." - 'Cause think lot people thinking, look, love blood work
repeatedly time, hard get financial reasons, also lot people
just don't know approach conversation. one things
hope can educate people on, deserve know going inside
body, makes doctor's visit worthwhile, don't feign
illness order it. - Right, yeah, lot people do. say, can't
afford tests, increasing number companies offer tests,
InsideTracker one them. just couple times year minimum.
can share doctor. can't afford that, say
doctor, main ones Andrew David do. - Yep, must.
email something like 555, phone number, rather, 555-5555.
think complaints, can just call number. David will pick
east coast business hours pick outside hours. -
main ones, say. blood sugar levels, want HbA1c,
average glucose levels month.

01:19:37 C-Reactive Protein, Cholesterol: Serum & Dietary

CRP, mentioned inflammation. - Yeah, talk C-reactive
protein second. 'Cause think shown early marker macular
degeneration heart disease, variety different things. CRP something
don't hear enough about, think. Maybe, know CRP don't,
guessing lot, but. - Oh, originally picked something associated
heart disease Framingham study, believe. best marker
cardiovascular inflammation also, use predictor longevity,
levels go mortality. association, enough data
say, high levels CRP, need get levels quickly.
levels usually go age levels inflammation. ways get
switch diet, eat less, try eat vegetables. find will
come down, also drugs can it. Anti-inflammatories can
well. CRP is, actually, hCRP, high sensitive hCRP, doctor will
know. Get one readings. 'Cause got normal blood sugar levels,
doctor, fasting blood sugar levels, doctor might say fine. lot
people normal blood sugar, high CRP, just bad


longterm, can predict future heart attack. - lines heart attack. want
thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want
heart attack give something, give now. 29,
satin, cholesterol way beyond 300, massive mess up.
Basically blood creamy look at. now got cholesterol low,
low levels be. can check InsideTracker, ratio
HDL LDL, want less five, now two, LDL
hundred, good. measured cardiovascular health MRI.
got movie heart beating. still got heart 20-year old, working,
willing forgo risk statin causing problems later family
history. people, say, aware statins aren't perfect drugs.
interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book
presence social media, Instagram, Twitter, appearances
podcasts,

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

thoughts cholesterol serum cholesterol dietary cholesterol. cannot,
life me, get arms around literature. even ignore essentially
nonsense various social media groups, saying cholesterol
worst thing world, cholesterol not, dietary cholesterol nothing
serum cholesterol nothing longevity. can't seem sort
basic data essentially ask, high levels LDL going kill earlier?
striving always reduce LDL increase HDL? reasonable goal?
so, dietary cholesterol primary determinant that? just final point
this, aware quite good data shows anorexics, people
essentially eat no food, unless force to, can often high LDL.
dietary cholesterol essentially zero, manufacturing lot own.
realize isn't primary area expertise, smart guy think
kind stuff lot. think going cholesterol literature?
will ever get bottom scientific medical community?
me, rather perplexing. - is, can get politics. know
fair bit cholesterol 'cause family history. headed early
death, grandmother stroke 30, bad terms genetics.
went statin, know lot people say statins long-term
bad. associated Alzheimer's disease. taking statins since 29.
'cause forced doctor give statin, conversation
something like this. young statin. said, what? want

interesting new ones. one called PCSK9 inhibitor, is,
think fortnightly, every two weeks injection, blocks release LDL liver.
seems great lowering cholesterol, also benefits


might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least

think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

might prolongevity. people just talking
cutting edge this, doctors trying drug instead statin.
talk doctor about. - avoid dietary cholesterol reason
also? Red meat, butter. mean, love butter. love red meat. realized
people don't. cholesterol little bit high, working bring
bit, although not altering food intake yet. think
relationship dietary cholesterol serum cholesterol, going
liver? anorexics? certain cholesterol high
eating nothing? - Well, there've number papers years
ignored. friend, Peter Attia, brought attention recently, new study
think definitively said dietary cholesterol almost zero impact blood
cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, annoyed 'cause avoiding eggs
butter life didn't to. eggs- - Plenty time, least
case. - Yeah, yeah. thing. can eat foods ones
banned difficult take cholesterol body gut.
synthesized body. - Well, just pausing second
think told. Six meals day, eat lot grains
fruits kind thing, avoid cholesterol. mean, basically everything learned

01:26:02 Amino Acids, Plants, Antioxidants

'80s '90s early 2000s getting flipped head now. But, think
strong caveat important mention, amino acids. particular,
amino acids come animal products, right? Seem pro aging effect
them, right? least way heard describe diet.
somebody enjoys meat, like it. no means, vegan all.
heard say eat mostly plants, little bit fish chicken something
sort eggs or. specifically avoid excessive amino acid intake?
something specific plants excites respect to? [chuckles] mean,
vegetables delicious too, it? something great plants
something bad think meat, guess biologist thinks amino
acids, right? don't think top sirloin, think amino acids. think top sirloin
eating it, really are, amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well,
two good things plants, neither taste me. eat steak


time could. kid, Australian. plants two
benefits. One highly nutritious, give lot vitamins
nutrients need. don't take multivitamin, don't want excess iron
body. high density nutrition. dark leaves, spinach salad,
great. second called xenohormetic molecules plants.
term, xenohormesis term came friend, Conrad. it's,
means stressed plants make molecules benefit health. break down. Xeno
means species, hormesis term, whatever doesn't kill makes
stronger live longer. idea plants stressed out, think
great vine dried starting harvest grapes, typically
done. full resveratrol, resveratrol plant defense molecule
think made activate sirtuin genes plant. plants sirtuins just
like do. purifying least concentrating light-proof bottle keeping
air, stabilize xenohormetic molecule, cocktail, not just one,
others wine. ingest get benefits activating
defenses, food getting stressed out. stressed, don't mean
psychologically stressed. mean, biologically stressed. try eat plants
gone bit stress. might brightly colored, much
sun got nibbled caterpillar. go places organic fresh,
local, plants aren't perfect, probably high
concentrations molecules. addition, also buy supplements make
sure getting enough well. - supplements mimic that? -
resveratrol will, another one called quercetin, quercetin, people call it,
find trace amounts apples onions. also showed back 2003
activates sirtuins well. others have, 20 years later, found kills
senescent cells helps kill senescent cells. double whammy
molecule. - actively picking peaches look like nibbled
caterpillar? - No, don't worry banged bit. -
story antioxidants? value whatsoever, way
describe beginning, heard recently not
rage anti-aging. useful? seeking
antioxidants anyway seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants not
going hurt unless take mega doses. need oxidants
immune system. even, called mitohormesis,


mitochondria power packs, need little bit free radicals able
function. don't want overdose antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E,
don't overdo it. - don't take multivitamin, correct? - Right. - think going stop
conversation 'cause always just taken one kind insurance
purpose, stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, just thinking, oh cap top off
ACBD. - Right, pee don't need, right, sure. - never
bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

bothered me. whole expensive pee thing never got. argument never got made
that. good vitamin not expensive. just figured better safe
sorry, may detrimental. - Well, can case iron discussed
antioxidants. came aging field early 1990s,
antioxidants. thought enzymes name catalyze
superoxide dismutase, well, going key longevity. turns
largely failure giving animals humans antioxidants, haven't
longevity benefits dreamed of. main reason lot
going just free radical damage. epigenome gets disrupted, got
proteins misfolding. problem really didn't realize
need turn body's natural defenses plus whole host
things get true benefits. not going say problem taking it,
antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice one full good stuff, including xenohormetic
molecules. resveratrol good case point, worked resveratrol
longevity molecule, first showed yeast worms flies mice.
that, thought resveratrol good heart red wine
drink red wine, antioxidant. showed extended
lifespan yeast cells genetic pathway, sirtuins. tested
whether resveratrol, change one atom make not antioxidant, guess what?
still worked fine. wasn't anti-oxidant activity extending lifespan.
ability turn yeast's defenses aging. Conversely, gave
yeast antioxidants, lived shorter. yeah, beginning
transformation thinking turn body's defenses, don't give antioxidants. -
opportunity say something wanting say long
time, that, wonderful science goal
mechanism, can really start understand just described, actually
mediates process different modulates process. mean, fire
alarm goes off building right now, going modulate attention. doesn't


mean controls attention, not mechanistically relevant. think
thing antioxidants one cases, sounds like right
ballpark, one really unveils mechanism have, can be, one can
field, can badly wrong long period time. sounds like sirtuins

01:33:45 Behaviors Extend Lifespan, Testosterone, Estrogen

really getting guts machinery causes cells age really
about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold
exposure. talked fasting. talked exercise broad terms,
evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits
lifestyle. - Sorry interrupt you. know episode
hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign

one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep

about. Zooming way out, behavioral tools one can start
think terms ways modulate these? Basically way DNA
expressed functioning. heard talk hormesis sorts, cold

evidence, exists, whether not aerobic training versus weight
training, sorts things. words, sorts things people
can improve sirtuin pathway? realized caveats. can't
go directly behavior dissertations, general theme, can people do,
do? - Right, well, know aerobic exercise mice rats raises
NAD levels levels sirt, one genes goes two actually, number
one number three. don't know yet type exercise optimal get
change. will learn, work. Now revealed work
military US, try understand kind thing. always tell
public, don't know something not going extrapolate.
do? base exercise scientific literature, shown maintaining
muscle mass important number reasons. two main ones are,
want maintain hormone levels. older male, losing testosterone
muscle mass time. exercising, will maintain have, fact,
probably haven't body like since 20. one benefits

hormones data humans show males
'80s '90s testosterone equivalent average 25 30-year-
olds. can get information, really impressive studies. Unfortunately,
didn't include lot information lifestyle factors, et cetera. idea
testosterone goes age, might trend, not necessarily
prerequisite. - Right, believe naturally increasing maintaining hormone


levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,

simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species

reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory

Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold

metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.

levels measuring long time. see me,
testosterone levels steadily, levels going down. - got tenure
went back again. [both chuckle] - No, actually became complacent.
worst. Actually age changed wrong direction that, 'cause
relaxed. - Interesting. - not worried future. got serious.
actually, according InsideTracker algorithm, got age 58 31
matter months. big drop. getting steadily younger
last 10 years, according measurement, blood test. - estrogen?
women different sense number eggs they,
ovaries change time, right? think can maintain estrogen
levels longer periods time using protocols? - Well, yeah,
get trouble certain university talk much. -
estrogen? - Just fertility long story. don't want get much
anecdotes, tell science, take mouse put
fasting caloric restriction point fertile,
year age, mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due fasting due
simply aging? - Due aging, due aging. fasting, not extreme fast, just
less calories. put back regular food, become fertile
many, many months afterwards. effect slowing aging also
reproductive system. - Interesting. - that, wouldn't say woman, wouldn't
think become super skinny try preserve fertility, not
saying. pathways work these, sirtuins known delay
infertility female animals. Case point, one lead authors paper
used NMN. Remember, gas, fuel, petrol sirtuins. gave
old mice. One group mice 16 months old. Remember became infertile 12,
gave NMN. think six weeks later, offspring.
became fertile again, goes biology, textbook biology,
female mammals run eggs. Turns not true. can rejuvenate
female reproductive system, even get come mouseopause call
it. whole new paradigm biology well. - super interesting. Sorry
interrupt you, reminded set studies done former
colleagues 'cause no longer there, David Hubel Torsten Wiesel, scientific
great grandparents. Won Nobel prize discovering, called critical periods,
phase early development brain extremely plastic. big part


work show certain point, critical period shuts down,
essentially brain can't change not nearly much. people came along
later showed open critical periods again, briefly,
takes specific stimulus, essentially, high degrees focus, et cetera.
However, well-known phenomenon literature take animal
degree, shown humans well, let pass
critical period, essentially sensory deprive them. take away
experience, close eyes. essentially reopen critical period. seems
like couldn't help mention this, parallel talking
fertility neuroplasticity, yes, timer certain
things available organism early life, tend taper off. not
open shut, taper off. deprivation can actually reactivate
availability process. Forgive me, just couldn't help mention it, me,
things associated youth, fertility neuroplasticity. think
it'd interesting.

01:40:35 Neuroplasticity & Neural Repair

love collaborate explore neuroplasticity might actually
regulated things like sirtuins. - Right, sirtuins control memory
neurons well. think really interesting learning work
colleagues done lab well, body
remarkable powers healing recovering illness injury.
thought one-way street just can't repair, can't get
diseases, can reset system, body can really get rejuvenated ways
future will wonder, didn't work earlier? future humanity
like us walking around like Deadpool. probably cleaner, won't
smell badly, Deadpool, don't know, can get injured just recover.
hard injure guy, going same. many species
cut off limb, limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. now learning
tap system. part, reversing age
cells, telling read genes correctly again, reversing age
epigenome. that, cells, brain, instance, skin.
optic nerve. - talk results second. want make sure


return behavioral protocols. amazing paper
end last year, cover article, full article nature, showing essentially small menu
transcription factors, control gene expression, et cetera, essentially
reverse age neurons eye rescue cells damage.
Essentially allow blind mice see again, offset degeneration retinal cells,
incredible paper, boom field. stand now terms
human clinical trials? mean, do, envisioning terms trajectory
data mice human someday? - Right, well, get point
immediately, going testing treatment monkeys, just safety reasons.
first patient done sometime 2022, early 2023, going
try recover blindness. - involves making injection virus eye,
right? Right now, no way aware manipulate transcription
factors pill other? - why, working lab
Harvard right now. will be- - will base moderation of- - Well pop pill
whole body gets rejuvenated 20 years. aiming for. Now
gene therapy eye places. IES, single injection,
genes go retina can turn on, drug called doxycycline.
mice four eight weeks, eye gets younger. can measure that'
cause can measure clock. vision comes back mice.
don't see reason, shouldn't work people structures
mechanisms human well. Now these- - one injection. -
one. - mention injections eye obviously nobody
outside ophthalmology clinic. definitely ophthalmologist but,
injections eye painless done correctly right person. sounds
dreadful, actually, seen done hundreds times. done it, thousands
times not myself, creatures. way
completely painless person- - Oh don't feel it. tiny, tiny needle too.
great thing one-time treatment. genes go back
eye stay there, forever. can just turn whenever want.
found can turn mice, get vision back,
turn off again. far, many months out, benefit remained,
decline, just turn back reset system, rinse repeat. one
day exciting potentially across entire body just
take antibiotic, every five years go back time time again. - thinking


body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed

reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies
dentists there, great physicist, Richard Feynman. story
not especially well-known, serious concerns, health concerns,
x-rays understood physics understood enough biology
that, actually quite vocal his, dislike dental technology dangers.
talked that.

01:59:00 Public Science Education, Personal Health

People can find internet, like. Speaking people who, like
Feynman, who've engaged public discourse science. One things
appreciate you, fact, way I, initially came know one
another public health education efforts. So, obviously
podcast, done Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse Lex,
still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast many podcasts, written
amazing book. thinking days terms world needs
terms of, education scientists, education MDs, education general
relates things because, think nothing else 2020 revealed us
gap, gap understanding. scientists guilty of, not knowing
information pub med elsewhere. just,
know, thinking general, like just know,
think world needs there? Maybe can recruit public educators. - Yeah.
Well, gone time, were, college young professors
way, get voice public either newspaper
short radio interview, extremely frustrating 'cause particularly
newspapers topic, every time twisted something not just
embarrassing, Harvard university used bring back office and- -
Frankenstein. - "How say thing? going live 250." didn't
say that. So, now also world overwhelmed information,
wrong anyone can pretend expert. gone early
days now future, experiencing right now thanks guys like you,
people like you, experts, experts, small number brilliant
good communicators talking directly public. never able
possible, time, right now. another five years now, certainly 10


years, hope trusted sources information people can not
just communicate, ideas directly, able talk things going
aren't even published yet say, "Here's really going on.
future looks like." somebody, like spent whole life studying
particular topic knows talking about. this, also something
think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked
university. people survive age, little older you.
survived bit longer. - lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah,
measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important
that, finally people like allowed universities talk public. used
it, real threat survival. People look me, "Oh, salesman,
promoting that." seen real negative, finally, think
world where, not negative anymore. pandemic showed needed
voices reason, voices fact, trust. can see popularity
podcast, shows public, desperate facts can trust,
'cause don't know believe anymore. - Well, completely honest
say this, that, know, followed lead. saw Joe Rogan
Podcast jaw dropped. like, "This amazing, like this." Because, get
good scientists but, tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,
Department Genetics. don't know, Harvard
course, Harvard Medical School excellent, course,
top, top tiers academia. certainly understand takes get
survive thrive there, like game pinball. never win. just,
just get to, really well, get keep playing. truth
academia. not, stop playing basically. saw you, explain
way accessible people also talking about,
possible protocols might explore see were, right
them. just, just dazzled excited, made every effort get contact
you. And, rest history, but, think really exciting days
2020 everything happened continues happen.
thirst knowledge. also direct public route


mentioned. And, think also openness, love thoughts this,
seems openness in, general public, health
practices, actually things people can control stress level,
control, sleep, control cholesterol do, maybe don't
even control lifespan, think remarkable. And, know speak
behalf many people, just, want say, thank you. You've, truly changed
course life. not sitting not example.
always say Sinclair, many people written books, many academics
written books, have, terms podcasts really getting
message way assume raised cortisol level heart
rate just little bit, nonetheless. truly first man that,
deserves nod. And, great debt gratitude that. thank
much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. a, become good friend super proud
done you, know will do. - addition book

02:05:40 Sinclair Test Can Take: www.doctorsinclair.com

recently noticed opened up, survey email/website people can,
access, excuse me, get information health rates aging.
Tell us measured. test
working on, secretly now soon, not secretly. - Yeah, well that, want,
credit score body make easy people follow health.
number, a, biological age can measure. Unfortunately, test
many hundreds dollars right now, lab, able bring
lot. want democratize test everybody access score
health can predict their, not just future health time death,
change it. building system will point people right direction give
discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
help that. get celebrate, negative birthday? - Absolutely. plan
people take age back year more, think can go back 20
years eventually, get birthday card negative birthday card.
[Andrew chuckles] - love it. probably little, actual birthday cake ingested
but, cares 'cause living much longer. - full stevia,* that'll fine.
[Both chuckle] thank talking us today. realized took us deep
guts mechanism well, talking global protocols, everything
one can take choose, right to, think whole
process that, talk talk lifespan always incredibly
illuminating.

body going head amazed, still isn't
simple, affordable technology allow just look body see
whether not tumors growing anywhere. mean, not hard look
body. mean technology exists. hasn't anybody created home
pseudo home solution, like clinic can go pay 50 bucks
hundred bucks see tumors growing anymore. - Yeah, still
expensive. can get doctor try get in, companies
offer blood tests look circulating DNA, that'll measure it. getting there.
still probably five 10 years away really cheap. can things like
colon cancer test home. think hundred something dollars. ship off
shit, excuse language, measure it. tell got colon
cancer, high probability, pandemic didn't want get
colonoscopy. - Mhmh, accurate accurate colonoscopy? - believe
close accurate. downside colonoscopy, can
pinch off polyps looking dangerous, whereas obviously isn't that,
certainly easier do. father Australian tells free
Australians.

01:46:19 Ice Baths, Cold Showers, “Metabolic Winter”

get test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. want return topic took us
away from. apologize, behavioral protocols. regularly cold
shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims, whole biz? [David chuckles]
- Well, know done least 'cause together. - right.
Not bath, just clear, sauna, different ice baths, [David
chuckles] idea Sinclair Huberman taking ice bath together a, might
warm people's hearts, just clear, different, ice bath, different,
different times. - Yeah, thank clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. don't
regularly. try sleep cool. sleep better anyway. try dress without lot warm
clothes. T-shirt middle summer, winter, try wear T-
shirt too. - challenging system thermoregulate? - Right, right. got
this, hypothesis Ray Cronise. published called Metabolic Winter
Hypothesis, is, tens thousands years ago, either hungry cold
really experience now. so, try give


metabolic winter part problem think obesity epidemic
never cold cold, cold burn energy. may slightly,
whole night, little bit cool, actually expend energy.
try that, not big fan cold showers. sauna, don't access
gym much did. So, want get back it. used regularly
son posted Instagram stay 15 minutes
stay three. Anyway, long story short,

01:48:07 Obesity & Accelerates Aging, GnRH

try compensate changes diet exercise get back it. -
reminded something meant ask earlier obesity reduces NAD levels
accelerates aging. How? mean, okay. again, the, scientist us,
someone's carrying lot excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat.
reduce NAD ways independent effects glucose
insulin? it, know, something direct white adipose tissue.
reason ask this, not simply dig mechanism alone, think
really interesting data now fat actually gets neural innervation. mean, not just a,
not just stored fuel. stored fuel, acting endocrine organ, essentially.
So, fat make people age faster? - Yeah, question that,
obvious, people ask it, makes good scientist.
don't know, give best answer, that, obesity comes along lot
problems that, include lot senescent cells fat, stain old fat senescent
cells, lights up. - Mhmh. kill off cells, least mice, maybe
humans, looks like fat less toxic body. 'Cause senescent cells
fat secreting inflammatory molecules will accelerate aging now
know. talk sirtuins NAD. we, just look philosophically,
sirtuins only, like come get activated body needs,
right adversity. cell surrounded fat contains lot fat, going
think times good, doesn't need switch on. evolutionary argument.
Mechanistically, don't know, something response
glucose, responds sirtuin gene, hasn't worked
well. - evidence leptin, hormone fat can actually, interact
sirtuin pathway? - don't recall seeing that- - Maybe sabbatical


lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,


shared sentiments x-rays dentist general? apologies

think people don't know scientists, tell lie, burst flames,
absolutely cannot tell something, untrue. best knowledge,
say is, don't, beaten up, we, kicked

measure with- - Yeah need, probably need little help, hopefully not much.
- measure that, work eating, really, really important

lab that'd fun one. - Definitely- - leptin development
triggers, permission hypothalamus enter puberty, right? - Yeah. -
kids eat lot young get overweight will also start go
undergo puberty quickly, although reproductive issues later. - Well yeah.
study hypothalamus together 'cause, hypothalamus is, can control
aging body. - interesting part brain. [Andrew chuckles] - sure.
- Yeah, absolutely. - turn SIRT1 gene, SIRT2 work on,
hypothalamus actually, will extend lifespan. Also, shown Dongsheng Cai
Albert Einstein College Medicine, you, inhibit inflammation
hypothalamus, mouse, will increase maintain expression called
GnRH, hormone that, found actually controls longevity mouse
part. keeping inflammation hypothalamus, sufficient extend
life span animals. reviewed paper nature seven years ago.
first demonstration hypothalamus one leading regulators
body's age. - find fascinating GnRH, don't know actually
comes neurons hypothalamus then, literally reached
pituitary trigger release things control fertility, luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. powerful set neurons, never
really clear, behavioral level triggers release GnRH.
stories pheromones timers puberty, et cetera, environmental
conditions dietary conditions

01:52:10 Methylation, Methylene Blue, Cigarettes

behaviors can control GnRH release, think, incredible area
exploration. love sabbatical way. couple, well seemingly
random questions, can't help, ask one thing like forage
internet practices least people doing, wonder
whether not basis it. mentioned methylation detrimental
process, way disrupts epigenome CD reader, speak.
people ingesting methylene blue. kid, used
methylene blue clean fish tank. love fish tanks. know aquaria
also, different podcast episode, talk aquaria, world,
people ingest methylene blue? Meaning logic correct? dangerous


practice? not sure want ingest methylene blue, sounds not like bad thing
do. - stains body seen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah,
someone lab postdoc using study completely different process
related blood-brain barrier used inject animals turn
blue, again, people ingest colloid silver. know put there,
this, please people don't do, just don't tell me, 'cause won't like it. They,
people put eyes people actually stain skin. actually
become kind silver purple brown color excessively. mean, lot
crazy stuff there. think thinking methylene blue
thing just get good psychiatrist? - don't know, sure. think
methylene blue found extend lifespan lower organism
came from. recollection- - emphasis lower organisms. - Yes
smaller organisms. think doesn't, remember Andrew it, interrupt
interfere mitochondrial activity that's- - Maybe it. -
Yeah. - [Andrew] Okay. - need look post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - get
bottom this, methods, talk those. - [Andrew] Yeah. -
methods placed right, part genome. get attached
right genes wrong genes. lot methylation, going mess
epigenome. Smoking will that, lack exercise, good stuff. you,
actually want want measure make sure
body, working. know actually
helping. can test age. take, swab mouth tell
old biologically. work trying bring
actually anecdotes now, people reversing age decade
just things talked cutting
edge stuff going write about. yet, measure stuff. That's,
didn't want forget bring up. measuring stuff time. blood tests
like you, got monitor stuck chest right now measuring
thousand times second measure biological age. - measuring
thousand times second? huge list things. - Yeah, yeah. this, little device
stuck two weeks just recharge send back get new
one. got body temperature movement, heart rate variability. FDA approved
device, not toy. not one recreational things. also listens voice,
eventually will need psychiatrist depressed, will tell sleep,


obviously. put data together individualized
anonymized, can now tell doctor real time, got cold needs
antibiotic, just virus. suffering COVID-19 even going
heart attack next week. little devices going us

01:56:17 X-Rays

time, instead going doctor year, ludicrous. -
ask x-rays. 'Cause every time go scanner airport, think,
"Sinclair never this." argument heard give
really excellent one, low level amount radiation, going
airport, argument always, well, just much plane
argument, counter-argument say was, "Well want
both, right? would?" go airport, assuming not running
late go standard line, say them?
say, "I'm David Sinclair." shuttle line. say?
say, "I don't like thing." give reason? - No, don't.
can say, "I don't want this." get annoyed 'cause hard pat
down, get pat done long not hurry,
fine. want pay TSA Pre America way get around
scanners, can that. travel lot, worth anyway, just go
metal detector, don't get scanned. - metal detector doesn't same,
problem. x-rays dentist? Yeah. - Well, know one x-ray
not going kill you. Two's not going kill you, I- - Three will kill you. No, just
kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - try limit cumulative. - Right. - went
six years without dental x-ray last visit, just gave up.
tired arguing dentist. gave one, got led coats
put lead body. telling something right there. funnily
enough, teeth hadn't changed. Now can balance saying, "Well, one x-ray,
two x-ray, three x-rays worth cavities." true, want know
there, regularly, me, don't think worth it,
teeth perfect health always been, don't cavities, didn't
braces, fine. stop scanning me. mean, know pay
machine, know, choice? Yes, stop pressuring me. - know,

discounts certain things will improve, not just health now, 10, 20,
30 years future. can measure that, cheaply, keep measuring
know right track, 'cause don't measure something, can't
optimize it. biological age test, developed it, simple mouth
swab. rolling out. building system right now. sign


sheet 'cause lot people want get line, go doctorsinclair.com, can get
one first people world get test see
doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people celebrating their, biological age birthdays?
words, minus, like can imagine, 45 right now, soon 46. I,
lucky get biological age 35 within 12 months, maybe can
