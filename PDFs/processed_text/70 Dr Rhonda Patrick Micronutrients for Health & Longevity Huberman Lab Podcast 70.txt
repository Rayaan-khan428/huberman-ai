00:09:42 Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis

Just use code Huberman checkout. now discussion Dr. Rhonda
Patrick. Rhonda, welcome. long time coming. Even longer
know because, even discussed coming podcast guest,
watching content long time. want start off saying thank
you. spearhead break academic science public
education. consider first in, rest us just wake. So, thank
that. been- - Oh, kind. Thank you. Thank much. Well,
absolutely true. - excited conversation you. - Thank you.
absolutely true. anyone research, realize statement just
made absolutely true isn't even close second. public facing
educators formal science training regular posting content came
several years initiated it, grateful. many questions,
want start off kind new old theme familiar with.
temperature powerful stimulus, know, biology, covered lot
material related utility cold also utility heat, and, learn
content various papers, seems bit
conundrum cold can stimulate number things, like increases metabolism,
brown fat, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, tell us those. heat seems
able lot things. wonder whether not discomfort
cold, deliberate cold exposure, discomfort heat might anchoring
pathway. So, mind sharing us little bit happens
get cold environment purpose, happens get hot
environment purpose? hoping might eventually lead us
point convergent understanding, would. - love to. take step
back. think brought really important point here. think point
intermittent challenging whether temperature


changes, like cold heat, types stressors, like physical activity,
perhaps even dietary compounds found plants. things like
polyphenols flavanols. Humans, evolved intermittently challenge ourselves.
Instacart, basically just get food delivered you,
Industrial Revolution occurred, hunting. say, we, not us
humans. gathering. moving, physically fit.
couldn't catch prey sedentary slob, right? moving,
pick berries. move. physical activity part
everyday life, caloric restriction intermittent fasting also part it.
another type challenge. didn't always prey caught, maybe
temperatures nothing us gather, right? food scarcity
something common well eating plants, getting compounds
mentioned. types stress, intermittent challenges, activate genetic
pathways bodies. often referred science stress response
pathways respond little bit stress. Physical activity strenuous.
Fasting's little bit stressful. Heat, cold. things types little intermittent
challenges. lot crosstalk stressors genetic
pathways activate. genetic pathways activated help
deal stress. way not beneficial help deal
little stressor, exercise heat, stays active, helps deal stress
normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
concept referred hormesis. little bit stressful challenge activates
stress response pathways beneficial way, net positive, actually
profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response, whatever response
is. production stem cells. cells help regenerate
different cells within tissues, something like autophagy, process can
clear away gunk inside cells, pieces DNA, protein aggregates.
find stress response pathways activated variety stressors. So,
example, one pathway called heat shock proteins, and, name imply,
one go, "Oh, activated heat." Well, correct. activated
robustly heat. can talk that. can eat plant like broccoli sprouts,
high something called sulforaphane. compound sort like
hormetic compound, or, David Sinclair likes say, xenohormetic compound.
love that. love term. activates heat shock proteins among things.


also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

00:09:42 Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis

Just use code Huberman checkout. now discussion Dr. Rhonda
Patrick. Rhonda, welcome. long time coming. Even longer
know because, even discussed coming podcast guest,
watching content long time. want start off saying thank
you. spearhead break academic science public
education. consider first in, rest us just wake. So, thank
that. been- - Oh, kind. Thank you. Thank much. Well,
absolutely true. - excited conversation you. - Thank you.
absolutely true. anyone research, realize statement just
made absolutely true isn't even close second. public facing
educators formal science training regular posting content came
several years initiated it, grateful. many questions,
want start off kind new old theme familiar with.
temperature powerful stimulus, know, biology, covered lot
material related utility cold also utility heat, and, learn
content various papers, seems bit
conundrum cold can stimulate number things, like increases metabolism,
brown fat, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, tell us those. heat seems
able lot things. wonder whether not discomfort
cold, deliberate cold exposure, discomfort heat might anchoring
pathway. So, mind sharing us little bit happens
get cold environment purpose, happens get hot
environment purpose? hoping might eventually lead us
point convergent understanding, would. - love to. take step
back. think brought really important point here. think point
intermittent challenging whether temperature


changes, like cold heat, types stressors, like physical activity,
perhaps even dietary compounds found plants. things like
polyphenols flavanols. Humans, evolved intermittently challenge ourselves.
Instacart, basically just get food delivered you,
Industrial Revolution occurred, hunting. say, we, not us
humans. gathering. moving, physically fit.
couldn't catch prey sedentary slob, right? moving,
pick berries. move. physical activity part
everyday life, caloric restriction intermittent fasting also part it.
another type challenge. didn't always prey caught, maybe
temperatures nothing us gather, right? food scarcity
something common well eating plants, getting compounds
mentioned. types stress, intermittent challenges, activate genetic
pathways bodies. often referred science stress response
pathways respond little bit stress. Physical activity strenuous.
Fasting's little bit stressful. Heat, cold. things types little intermittent
challenges. lot crosstalk stressors genetic
pathways activate. genetic pathways activated help
deal stress. way not beneficial help deal
little stressor, exercise heat, stays active, helps deal stress
normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
concept referred hormesis. little bit stressful challenge activates
stress response pathways beneficial way, net positive, actually
profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response, whatever response
is. production stem cells. cells help regenerate
different cells within tissues, something like autophagy, process can
clear away gunk inside cells, pieces DNA, protein aggregates.
find stress response pathways activated variety stressors. So,
example, one pathway called heat shock proteins, and, name imply,
one go, "Oh, activated heat." Well, correct. activated
robustly heat. can talk that. can eat plant like broccoli sprouts,
high something called sulforaphane. compound sort like
hormetic compound, or, David Sinclair likes say, xenohormetic compound.
love that. love term. activates heat shock proteins among things.


also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

that. been- - Oh, kind. Thank you. Thank much. Well,
absolutely true. - excited conversation you. - Thank you.
absolutely true. anyone research, realize statement just
made absolutely true isn't even close second. public facing
educators formal science training regular posting content came
several years initiated it, grateful. many questions,
want start off kind new old theme familiar with.
temperature powerful stimulus, know, biology, covered lot
material related utility cold also utility heat, and, learn
content various papers, seems bit
conundrum cold can stimulate number things, like increases metabolism,
brown fat, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, tell us those. heat seems
able lot things. wonder whether not discomfort
cold, deliberate cold exposure, discomfort heat might anchoring
pathway. So, mind sharing us little bit happens
get cold environment purpose, happens get hot
environment purpose? hoping might eventually lead us
point convergent understanding, would. - love to. take step
back. think brought really important point here. think point

changes, like cold heat, types stressors, like physical activity,
perhaps even dietary compounds found plants. things like
polyphenols flavanols. Humans, evolved intermittently challenge ourselves.

everyday life, caloric restriction intermittent fasting also part it.
another type challenge. didn't always prey caught, maybe
temperatures nothing us gather, right? food scarcity
something common well eating plants, getting compounds
mentioned. types stress, intermittent challenges, activate genetic
pathways bodies. often referred science stress response
pathways respond little bit stress. Physical activity strenuous.
Fasting's little bit stressful. Heat, cold. things types little intermittent
challenges. lot crosstalk stressors genetic
pathways activate. genetic pathways activated help
deal stress. way not beneficial help deal
little stressor, exercise heat, stays active, helps deal stress
normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
concept referred hormesis. little bit stressful challenge activates
stress response pathways beneficial way, net positive, actually
profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response, whatever response
is. production stem cells. cells help regenerate
different cells within tissues, something like autophagy, process can
clear away gunk inside cells, pieces DNA, protein aggregates.
find stress response pathways activated variety stressors. So,
example, one pathway called heat shock proteins, and, name imply,
one go, "Oh, activated heat." Well, correct. activated
robustly heat. can talk that. can eat plant like broccoli sprouts,
high something called sulforaphane. compound sort like
hormetic compound, or, David Sinclair likes say, xenohormetic compound.
love that. love term. activates heat shock proteins among things.


also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

00:09:42 Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis

Just use code Huberman checkout. now discussion Dr. Rhonda
Patrick. Rhonda, welcome. long time coming. Even longer
know because, even discussed coming podcast guest,
watching content long time. want start off saying thank
you. spearhead break academic science public
education. consider first in, rest us just wake. So, thank
that. been- - Oh, kind. Thank you. Thank much. Well,
absolutely true. - excited conversation you. - Thank you.
absolutely true. anyone research, realize statement just
made absolutely true isn't even close second. public facing
educators formal science training regular posting content came
several years initiated it, grateful. many questions,
want start off kind new old theme familiar with.
temperature powerful stimulus, know, biology, covered lot
material related utility cold also utility heat, and, learn
content various papers, seems bit
conundrum cold can stimulate number things, like increases metabolism,
brown fat, et cetera, et cetera. Hopefully, tell us those. heat seems
able lot things. wonder whether not discomfort
cold, deliberate cold exposure, discomfort heat might anchoring
pathway. So, mind sharing us little bit happens
get cold environment purpose, happens get hot
environment purpose? hoping might eventually lead us
point convergent understanding, would. - love to. take step
back. think brought really important point here. think point
intermittent challenging whether temperature


changes, like cold heat, types stressors, like physical activity,
perhaps even dietary compounds found plants. things like
polyphenols flavanols. Humans, evolved intermittently challenge ourselves.
Instacart, basically just get food delivered you,
Industrial Revolution occurred, hunting. say, we, not us
humans. gathering. moving, physically fit.
couldn't catch prey sedentary slob, right? moving,
pick berries. move. physical activity part
everyday life, caloric restriction intermittent fasting also part it.
another type challenge. didn't always prey caught, maybe
temperatures nothing us gather, right? food scarcity
something common well eating plants, getting compounds
mentioned. types stress, intermittent challenges, activate genetic
pathways bodies. often referred science stress response
pathways respond little bit stress. Physical activity strenuous.
Fasting's little bit stressful. Heat, cold. things types little intermittent
challenges. lot crosstalk stressors genetic
pathways activate. genetic pathways activated help
deal stress. way not beneficial help deal
little stressor, exercise heat, stays active, helps deal stress
normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
concept referred hormesis. little bit stressful challenge activates
stress response pathways beneficial way, net positive, actually
profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response, whatever response
is. production stem cells. cells help regenerate
different cells within tissues, something like autophagy, process can
clear away gunk inside cells, pieces DNA, protein aggregates.
find stress response pathways activated variety stressors. So,
example, one pathway called heat shock proteins, and, name imply,
one go, "Oh, activated heat." Well, correct. activated
robustly heat. can talk that. can eat plant like broccoli sprouts,
high something called sulforaphane. compound sort like
hormetic compound, or, David Sinclair likes say, xenohormetic compound.
love that. love term. activates heat shock proteins among things.


also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


changes, like cold heat, types stressors, like physical activity,
perhaps even dietary compounds found plants. things like
polyphenols flavanols. Humans, evolved intermittently challenge ourselves.
Instacart, basically just get food delivered you,
Industrial Revolution occurred, hunting. say, we, not us
humans. gathering. moving, physically fit.
couldn't catch prey sedentary slob, right? moving,
pick berries. move. physical activity part
everyday life, caloric restriction intermittent fasting also part it.
another type challenge. didn't always prey caught, maybe
temperatures nothing us gather, right? food scarcity
something common well eating plants, getting compounds
mentioned. types stress, intermittent challenges, activate genetic
pathways bodies. often referred science stress response
pathways respond little bit stress. Physical activity strenuous.
Fasting's little bit stressful. Heat, cold. things types little intermittent
challenges. lot crosstalk stressors genetic
pathways activate. genetic pathways activated help
deal stress. way not beneficial help deal
little stressor, exercise heat, stays active, helps deal stress
normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, just life, aging, right?
concept referred hormesis. little bit stressful challenge activates
stress response pathways beneficial way, net positive, actually
profound antioxidant, anti-inflammatory response, whatever response
is. production stem cells. cells help regenerate
different cells within tissues, something like autophagy, process can
clear away gunk inside cells, pieces DNA, protein aggregates.
find stress response pathways activated variety stressors. So,
example, one pathway called heat shock proteins, and, name imply,
one go, "Oh, activated heat." Well, correct. activated
robustly heat. can talk that. can eat plant like broccoli sprouts,
high something called sulforaphane. compound sort like
hormetic compound, or, David Sinclair likes say, xenohormetic compound.
love that. love term. activates heat shock proteins among things.


also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

also activates powerful detoxification pathway called Nrf2, helps
detoxify things like carcinogens exposed to. Well, guess what? Heat activates
that. getting overlap. Cold also activates heat shock proteins.
like, "Really? Cold?" Yes, activates. stress response pathways,
activated various types stressors. Now, going robustly
activate heat shock proteins heat versus cold, overlap. think
sort forms foundation there. - Yeah, helpful. brings mind,
context nervous system, always tell people small kit
neurochemicals work with. isn't dopamine Netflix, dopamine
relationship, dopamine work, et cetera. Dopamine generic pathway
motivation, craving, pursuit emerge, et cetera, just like adrenaline generic theme
many different behaviors. seems job biological systems able
take diverse range inputs, even unknown inputs. Like, don't know
technology will look like three years, can bet novel
technologies will tap systems talking now. certainly
will stressors come will tap pathways. two
questions related just said

00:16:38 Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane

talk little bit cold heat. mentioned plants route
creating intermittent challenge. lot debate, mostly online, whether
not plants friends plants trying kill us. extreme version
carnivore types, pure carnivore diet types, plants trying kill us.
plant-based diet folks, seems like healthy planet,
animals, maybe us. But, set aside argument, just raise
hypothesis plants compounds bad us, maybe consuming
small amounts, creating hormesis type scenario, think
conceivably solve problem. say, yes, plants bad us, but, small
amounts, provide hormetic response good us, right? So,
way much heat bad us, much cold bad us, can kill us, can
kill neurons, but, appropriately dosed, intermittent challenge type scenario, can
good us. think plants compounds?
think good us bad us? sharp blade, want


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

Twitter. There, teach science science-based tools, overlap
content Huberman Lab Podcast, much distinct content


Huberman Lab Podcast. Thank you, again, joining discussion
Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


use potently. - actually think almost impossible. mean,
eat nothing plant day, every day large. bioavailability
compounds plants, attached food matrix. not like taking
supplement form well. difficult make toxic. Now,
cases, example, eat cabbage, think group Africa
somewhere eat cabbage, goitrogen cabbage.
not sulforaphane. another compound. eat, every day. Nothing
that. - get goiter. thick neck. - Yeah, iodine deficient top that.
think, can, course, make. mean, types plants toxic
small quantities, right? - Hemlock. - [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. - Will kill you. Folks,
don't play game hemlock. - not going get poisoned eating
serving broccoli dinner, right? So, mean, depends plant.
generalizations kind of, just not useful, think lot people online
blogosphere, gravitate towards just easier, lot
sensational. - eat plants, meat, starches. one rare omnivores
now. - do, too. - feel like rare omnivore. think, step
social media, said, blogosphere, people, say, 99%
people planet probably omnivores. - Right. - someone will probably
correct me, doubt number falls 98. - think, look data,
carnivore data, can't wait see it, but, right now, lot of, okay, well,
lot anecdotal evidence, lot good starts anecdotes, people
change thousand things once, don't realize that, do.
anecdotal data good, right? starting point. don't really know
long-term carnivore diets going do. may beneficial short-term.
may beneficial reasons elimination things. knows, right? Lots
possibilities. think, respect plants, much evidence, like,
example, sulforaphane one really like just evidence
sulforaphane powerful activator Nrf2 pathway. pathway
regulates lot genes, lot genes related glutathione production, genes
involved detoxifying compounds exposed food, like
heterocyclic amines. fact, GWAS studies. studies
genome-wide associated studies, people listening aren't familiar. People
variety versions genes, gene able make heterocyclic
amines basically detoxify not harmful. people don't certain


version

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

00:21:12 Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed

well prone colon cancer increased cancer risk,
eat lot broccoli cruciferous vegetables, negates risk
getting sulforaphane, activates lot glutathione transferase synthase
genes. glutathione's major antioxidant brain, vascular system,
body, basically. evidence eating things like compounds like
sulforaphane broccoli broccoli spouts, 100 times
sulforaphane broccoli, activating glutathione brain. human
evidence that. mean, amazing. - [Andrew] amazing. - Plasma. Yeah.
- Sorry interrupt. just want make sure. broccoli sprouts different
broccoli, just told us much richer compounds. So, note
self, broccoli sprouts, not just broccoli. Can cook broccoli still
get nutrients, eat raw? confess, eating raw broccoli really
aversive me. - sulforaphane formed compound called glucoraphanin,
broccoli, enzyme converted sulforaphane myrosinase,
heat sensitive. somewhat lower sulforaphane levels
cook broccoli. However, study years back showed adding one
gram mustard seed powder, ground mustard seed powder, also contains
myrosinase enzyme, cooked broccoli increases sulforaphane fourfold,
so... - great 'cause, confess, like broccoli cooked appropriate
density, not mushy definitely not raw. idea eating raw broccoli just
sounds horrible, like way mustard seed sounds. just little bit mustard
seed powder added cooked broccoli can recover compounds. -
Yes, will lightly steam broccoli, add little bit
Kerrygold butter, add mustard seed powder top that.
got little kick. just little spice. don't taste that, expired.
little kick. - know people will want know often
much, eating every day days week? - Well, shifted
supplementation sulforaphane. admitting right now terrible
past, don't know, six months so.



00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

00:23:50 Tool 2: Moringa & Nrf2 Antioxidant Response

- supplementation broccoli? - Yes, supplementation.
another way get. another compound, actually called moringa. Dr.
Jed Fahey, really expert sulforaphane. good friend mine.
podcast couple times. basically thinks, done lot
research marina well, like cousin, activates Nrf2 pathways
similarly sulforaphane. buying Kuli Kuli moringa powder. don't
affiliation him. - Kuli Kuli brand? - Kuli Kuli's brand. -
no affiliation to. - no affiliation, Jed Fahey researched it, like
specific brand, legit. science backed terms actually containing
moringa activating Nrf2. add smoothies.
doing. - dose ranges? And, course, give usual
recommendations people talk physician, et cetera, et cetera. But,
people going to, take? always the... - big, heaping tablespoon.
- take David Sinclairian approach, talk does,
way deal this. course, everybody's different should, seriousness,
anytime add delete something consumption consult
trusted healthcare professional, trusted you. recall dosages? - big,
heaping tablespoon. - Kuli Kuli moringa. sounds like song.

00:25:25 Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) & Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination)

- K. know, does. But, people also listening, like, "Well,
that?" mentioned glutathione brain. mentioned plasma.
shown lower DNA damage people, white blood cells. several
different studies China. China, lot air pollution. mentioned
powerful activator Nrf2. know familiar Nrf2. Nrf2
transcription factor is, binding little specific sequence variety different
genes, turning on, or, cases, turning off. regulating
activated not activated, turned off. genes
basically detoxifying pathways. talked little bit glutathione,
also ones involved airborne carcinogens, like benzene. benzene's
found air pollution. mean, cigarette smoke. smoking cigarettes still, please


try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

try quit. - Yeah, mutating DNA. - [Rhonda] Yeah, worst. - say
nothing lung cancer, mutating DNA. - heart disease risk. Heart
disease risk. But, anyways. People, repeated one study,
literally 24 hours taking, can't remember off top head
dose sulforaphane broccoli extract, broccoli seed extract was, broccoli sprouts
extract, not seed. sprouts. Anyways, started excreting 60% benzene
acrolein. something get cooked food. - coming
urine? - Coming urine. Yeah. - Well, not smoker,
honest. rare hear supplement first time 'cause deep-diving
supplements since teens.

00:27:10 Plants & Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges

fascinating, brings back question before,
appreciate answered clearly. Plants compounds good
us. not just stressing us. activating pathways reparative.
taking away everything telling me. - Right,
bodies, supposed getting stress pathways activated.
know, right? mean, conserved among different animals. something is,
supposed happen. And, modern day world, don't eat plants.
don't move anywhere exercise. don't go periods not
eating food can fingertips second, right? So, mean,
got conundrum of, never activating stress response pathways
supposed activate. supposed to. - find fascinating, again,
drawing parallel nervous system, hearing say that, historically,
go stress, confront cold confront heat,
confront effort hunger, exercise, essentially, order obtain
compounds, compounds reparative. Yeah, feel resembles
dopamine pathway. always say nothing wrong dopamine. People think
dopamine hits bad dopamine bad. absolutely nothing wrong
dopamine. problem dopamine, especially high levels dopamine, released
without need effort access dopamine problematic. line cocaine
gives ton dopamine no effort except ingest drug, whereas working
four years get degree will release lot dopamine lot cortisol


along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

along way, know, considered healthy accomplishment
cases, tremendous amount. approaching spring, there'll lot
graduations. Weddings coming now pandemic hopefully slowing.
there'll lot dopamine. High levels dopamine great, effort
done something order access it. taking away
saying need go intermittent, different types
intermittent challenge, rewarded particular compounds
reparative, challenge, make us stronger.

00:29:35 Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2

Hormesis really is, seems, case doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.
mentioned- - Can add one thing just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. -
shown with, example, sulforaphane animal studies,
precondition, give animal sulforaphane, expose hypoxia
kind ischemic stroke condition, whatever induce that,
sulforaphane, basically protects them. precondition stress response
pathways primed, so, exposed ischemic stroke,
outcomes much better, much better animals didn't get
sulforaphane 48 hours whatever was. shown multiple
animal studies sulforaphane specifically brain. know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark
Mattson. often thought intermittent fasting king, neuroscientist,
publish work talks sulforaphane well. - really glad
brought up, example up, many questions get social media
elsewhere traumatic brain injury. TBI just one example. people
always think, "Oh, sports. football." Whenever say TBI, people always think
football. just want just take moment editorialize. 90% traumatic
brain injury construction work, at-home accidents. Football players, hockey players,
martial artists tiny fraction people TBI concussion various
kinds. just happens that, within communities, many them, 75% more,
experience those. salient within communities, concussion prominent.
People always asking, "What can "in order offset brain injury? "I
concussion two years ago. can do?" tough question
really don't anything them. mean, tell sleep well, eat well, exercise,


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


sounds like reparative pathways either explored
context brain injury or, guessing, explored context brain injury. -
Yeah, couple things there. One that, mean, traumatic brain injury, terrible,
interesting also like literal, real-time brain aging. able
accelerate understand. often think of, think traumatic brain injury,
think much overlap Alzheimer's disease dementia
neurodegenerative diseases lot similarities there. so,
sulforaphane, personally think, think animal research
TBI sulforaphane, mostly preconditioning rather treatment. So, again, like,
well, want healthy lifestyle thing construction worker, fill
blank, going to. mean, anyone drives car, risk
degree, right? - [Andrew] bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. - Around Stanford, say
people demonize motorcycles, people demonize lot things, moving fast
space small object next 3,000 pound vehicle, mean, number
friends died. number people traumatic brain injury. not
cycling cyclists, risky sport stretch. So, taking things like
moringa eating broccoli sprouts, maybe cooking little less
currently cooking them, putting mustard seed. evidence that? Well, first
all, Nrf2 expressed neurons, cells protected.
cells body possibly gain protection pathways? - Well, lungs
one, just even plasma cells. think Nrf2 pretty ubiquitously expressed. Liver.
many animal studies looked things. try kind
gravitate towards human ones 'cause lot relevant. think, overall, like
mentioned, DNA damage lower. like 24 34% lower human blood cells
broccoli sprout powder supplementation. - [Andrew] Wow. - made video
years ago, 2016 maybe, think references exact amounts.
can't remember. - can link video. - kind old video. 2016.
also Jed podcast, talk this. also shown
randomized controlled trials help treat autism autistic symptoms. Yet again,
interesting things brain, think something
oxidative stress, glutathione, relevant TBI treatment. hasn't
shown empirically helps treatment, think someone
study. think done, honestly, low-hanging fruit,
mean, impact. least one preliminary study glutathione


increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

increased brain humans basically taking sulforaphane. - is, really,
people listening, important number compounds people
take supplement form don't cross blood-brain barrier, get metabolized
ways listed bottle almost becomes irrelevant cells
actually experience. reassuring. will get back heat cold
theme tried surface,

00:35:08 Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA & DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation

just find interesting diverge point themes. So,
compounds micronutrients place top tier useful, interesting?
animal studies. Maybe hopefully also human studies.
talked few. know talked lot omega-3 fatty acids. So,
top three, superstars nutrients brain body, sounds like
got one set, put alongside them? - Omega-3, marine omega-3
fatty acids. found marine types animals, fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.
three fatty acids. one plant, often referred ALA,
people call short, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,
docosahexaenoic acid, DHA. Yeah, EPA- - amazed can
pronounce two difficult words pronounce spell right next
ophthalmology, which, can spell it. know people appointments
ophthalmology departments don't know spell ophthalmology. Little secret.
extra P there. ALA. not going attempt pronounce
pronunciation perfect two compounds. said
marine sources, fish, sardines, cod, sort thing, krill?
seen krill oil. years back, people saying krill better source omega-3s
fish oil. took krill oil capsules, made itch over, stopped. -
shellfish allergy? - No, don't think so. - No, okay. - don't think so. not
big fan shellfish, oysters every now again, shrimp something,
feel fine. - Yeah, can talk sources. krill source mostly type
DHA EPA phospholipid form. phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty
acid, different the, well, talking fish oil
supplements, different story, talking comparing fish eating
krill, like talking food. - Oh, never eat krill. - Okay. talking


supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

supplements? - Yes, apologize. - Fish oil supplements. - Yeah, krill
supplement versus fish oil supplement, and, fits conversation, talking
great sources omega-3s whole form. bad feeling going tell
sardines. - Sardines are, yeah, awesome. Anyways. - Except taste. -
potential contaminants. Mercury, think, one. No. Yeah, mercury.
Joe telling about, used eat sardines everyday. Joe Rogan telling
used eat sardines every day, really high mercury levels.
really shocked sardines low fish groups. higher
get, like swordfish sharks, like, really high mercury 'cause eating
fish, right? think brands, look ConsumerLab. ConsumerLab,
like third-party site not affiliated with, use lot
analysis different foods supplements. can look
sardines, list ones pretty decent. But, anyways, back
question fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. one major
differences fish oil supplements, get high quality one, triglyceride
form. got glycerol backbone three fatty acids attached,
either DHA EPA. Or, lower quality fish oil supplement,
called ethyl ester form. And, typically, reason that, fish oil
purified, run column alcohol something. cleave off,
glycerol backbone, just kind easier leave like re-esterifying
it, costs money. can get ethyl ester form, isn't
bioavailable. And, fact, don't take food, going trouble.
not going absorb much all. - see packaging?
going say ethyl form? - official brands will put website,
perhaps packaging, but, time, dig website
and/or call them. think, part, ones higher end will market it, like
triglyceride form. not ethyl ester's bad. just means take food. one
major prescription omega-3s is, actually, Lovaza,
mixture DHA EPA, well Vascepa, highly purified EPA.
prescribed physicians patients hypertriglyceridemia, high triglycerides
among things, think maybe dysregulation lipids well. - amazing.
people, prescription drugs essentially high-potency, purified
omega-3s, given people lipid issues. treatment issues
fat metabolism giving people fat. - Yes. - just want push home, again, not


carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

carnivore keto anything, omnivore, just push home one thing
wonderful done years continue move away
broad, sweeping statements fat bad. case
saying fat not good, can used combat issues fat metabolism. fats
not just one thing. many things. anyway, just want put little
highlighter point appreciation make sure people sensitized
fact that, hear fat bad, ask, kind fat?
talking omega-3s. Okay, triglyceride form can taken
without food, prescription forms. don't know can get ahold
prescription form unless- - high triglycerides. - friend high
triglycerides. No. illegal, folks. Don't share prescription drugs. - talk
doctor say, "I'm already taking from..." mean, don't know works.
Anyways. - dosage recommend people get? One way another. -
right, okay, dosage physicians prescribe high triglycerides,
example, four grams day. - Four grams EPA. - Yes, Vascepa. think
Lovaza's also prescribed four grams day. can get either
physician. father-in-law just got one 'em prescribed. buying
omega-3 years years. like, hey, can actually get health
insurance can cover it. really purified form, take food.
bottom line. totally gone tangents, asking
interesting questions anyway. - Well, normally ask mechanism talk
protocols, the- - why. - [Andrew] why. - mean, haven't
gotten yet. - definitely will get there, think number people
nowadays just really excited can health, so, here,
just raising importance omega-3s, definitely get
underlying mechanism. - Yeah, think four grams is, mean, fact, Bill Harris,
Dr. Bill Harris, just one pioneers omega-3 fatty acid research.
podcast last August. saying reason FDA chose literally just
much get people take. wasn't like upper end, like
anything unsafe. wasn't case. mean, just purely cost
compliance, can get pill, amount can get, many
pills can get people take. - smiling good friend Satchin Panda
Salk Institute, done lot important work intermittent fasting
incredible work circadian rhythms, et cetera. talking preparation


episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

episode intermittent fasting, said, "Why eight-hour feeding window?"
said, "Well, graduate student "who ran studies partner." think
girlfriend, recall. Hope didn't get backward. partner said, "Listen,
can lab "10 hours day, can't lab 14 hours day "if want
relationship work." eight hours feeding window, plus
measurements time walk lab, park car, et cetera. eight-
hour feeding window everyone holds holy actually just born
relationship two graduate students. single, single
graduate school, anyway, lived lab. So, it'd me,
intermittent fasting mean eating 14 hours day. joke. Not good one,
just want make clear. joking. point making really good
one, four gram amount not threshold based anything except
threshold people's willingness actually take stuff. think important
people hear. often hear eight-hour feeding window, four grams
EPA, 150 minutes cardio, really question can reasonably
study. - take four grams day. take two morning, two grams morning,
take two grams evening. take EPA morning, take DHA
evening. - split them. - do. don't know. don't think necessary,
necessarily. just happen get certain fish oil supplement separates them.
so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's great one, one, easier. -
someone doesn't prescription? take over-the-counter fish oil. know feel
better 'cause done experiment going off. take mainly for, don't
depression, mood better. joints feel better. just feel better. like
think platelets slipperier, cruising little
obstructions veins arteries. image head, don't
data support part. - Yeah, mean, so, asking for, like,
people get fish oil supplements? - say look bottle, says two
grams per serving, look, 750 milligrams EPA 1,000 milligrams
EPA. say half EPA. Then, want hit threshold EPA threshold
listed bottle, front bottle? understanding
need hit threshold level EPA order derive important benefits. -
think two grams good threshold. Now, International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,
website third-party testing ton different fish oil
supplements around world, measure concentration omega-3


fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

fatty acids actual supplement, nothing ever says bottle,
also measure contaminants, mercury, PCBs, dioxins, things
find potentially fish harmful humans, also measure mercury
oxidized fatty acids. omega-3 fatty acids polyunsaturated fatty acids,
extremely prone oxidation. please keep fish oil refrigerator
colder. Yeah, extremely prone. - Mine's cupboard, now
know. - shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. - No, makes perfect sense. Yeah. -
So, anyways, measure that. typically like look for, give total
oxidation number. called T-O-T-O-X. TOTOX call short. like
least 10, ideally six. really hard find right mixtures
things, people can go website, can browse products.
put together Excel sheet, YouTube little screencast yet
publish, press publish button on, it, basically, go back check
update 'cause different lot numbers products.
like 20, 27 something. gone found top picks high EPA
brands high DHA brands. buy some, ones choose
low total oxidation high concentration either EPA DHA.
Now, people can go themselves. just takes work. - No, glad
work. going put tweet every week. - Oh no! - tagged
list published online. Sorry, Rhonda, going it. know sadistic
me, service community myself. - Yes, chose five brands
each, tried find one Europe one Canada. - Great. - great
selection US other. - Thank work. don't want work,
trust you. So, yeah, try get two grams per day EPA supplementation.

00:48:40 EPA Omega-3s & Depression

now put refrigerator. Mood better. made decision mainly based
data aware of, looking comparison people anywhere two
four grams EPA per day compared SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
treatment depression, don't want take SSRI don't to,
fortunately, don't to, data, read, remarkable. People take
things sufficient doses, meaning EPAs, able get much lower
dosages SSRIs depression relief or, cases, come off SSRIs


completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

completely avoid going antidepressant medication. Now, course, not
something people cowboy. Mental health issues serious.
reasons, love thoughts that, mental health part, maybe
tell us things getting two four grams EPA per day going
help brain rest body. - So, know? actually
published paper back 2015 role omega-3 vitamin D depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulsive behavior. But, so, within paper,
background research, review article, way, just connecting
dots 'cause love that. - going grab paper. confess, don't know
paper, love quality reviews references useful. - Well,
huge role inflammation, cause inflammation depression. think
short animated video well, years ago, back publishing
work, people injected lipopolysaccharide. something
generating gut, mostly gut permeability, happens lot.
Endotoxin, also called. endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. basically outer
membrane bacterial cells bacteria die, like immune cells gut
come contact bacteria drank alcohol five days row
whatever, release endotoxin, something stressed us out. release endotoxin
body, causes inflammation. can inject people
lipopolysaccharide cause depressive symptoms. However, take
cohort people, give EPA, think somewhere around two grams,
inject lipopolysaccharide. establishing causation here, right?
totally, depressive symptoms, versus placebo. placebo saline control.
placebo controlled obviously hugely important depression.
ameliorated depressive symptoms caused lipopolysaccharide. -
Amazing, LPS, lipopolysaccharide, no joke. Years ago, working
thermal regulation, inject animals LPS induce fever. vagus nerve
registers presence LPS signals particular hyperglycemic areas
cranks body temperature because, basically, signal body infected.
Amazing. will continue two grams per day. Maybe ramp four.
not DHA separately. DHA supplement. - Yes. - [Andrew]
okay?

00:52:02 Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements?



- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

00:54:23 Benefits Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

- Yes. Yeah, yeah. kind of... Boy, got lot things hit back
one original questions krill oil versus fish oil. - Yes, still cue. - DHA,
specifically, phospholipid form, bioavailable. So, comparing exact
quantity concentration triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, will get
plasma cells, plasma, plasma cell, plasma krill oil. However,
krill oil supplements low dose. mean, good luck getting two grams omega-3
krill oil. also, krill oil supplements notoriously rancid. don't know
whatever reason. - Maybe made itchy over. - think just...
haven't found good krill oil supplement. pretty much stay away it. mean,
smell too, mean, just smells rancid. So, thing is, also published
paper back 2019, yeah, something like that, DHA phospholipid form
getting brain different mechanism DHA triglyceride form.
going transporter called MFSD2A transporter. think
relevant people APOE4 allele, so- - People Alzheimer's susceptibility.
- Right, like 25% population allele gene called APOE4, and,
basically, APOE, four referred bad kind version it.
something bodies. also brain. people one versions,
got one mom dad, twofold increased risk
Alzheimer's disease. get two, much more, less common. think
like 2% population something two alleles, like 10 11-fold
increased risk Alzheimer's disease. role phospholipid form DHA
brain, also make phospholipid DHA inside body.

can taking triglyceride forms. two grams
magic number, think. kind back fish oil. personally think one
powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things can get
easily, relatively easily, going powerfully modulate way think, way
feel, way age. variety different types studies kind led
conclusion, variety observational studies. lots work Dr.
Bill Harris collaborators looking at, called Omega-3 Index.
actually omega-3 level red blood cells. red blood cells turn every


120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

120 days. long-term marker omega-3 status. different 99.9%
study see lab go get omega-3 levels tested.
getting plasma phospholipid levels tested, kind like can think as,
eat couple days before? Oh, fish. omega-3 levels great.
eat fish like every week, like went dinner? not great
biomarker long-term omega-3 status. kind like fasting blood glucose levels
versus HbA1c, like long-term marker blood glucose levels.
Omega-3 Index. done variety studies, observational studies. So, people
listening, studies obviously flawed not establishing
causality. looking people's lifestyles. But, case Bill Harris's work,
measuring something. measuring Omega-3 Index. measuring
Omega-3 Index people, looking mortality risk, example,
cardiovascular disease risk. found that, first all, standard American
diet Omega-3 Index 5%. Japan, contrast, Omega-3 Index around
10 11%. Big difference there. also five-year increased life
expectancy compared people US. - think mainly due fish
intake, seafood intake? - showed was, think big part it. mean,
can't says thing, showed data that, think
Framingham Study, looked Omega-3 Index, people
Omega-3 Index 4% lower, close standard American little bit
lower, five-year decreased life expectancy compared people
8% Omega-3 Index. big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy.
really interesting thing, Andrew. also looked smokers, smokers
omega-3 levels, stratified it, found smokers no omega-3
like worst all. mean, just like worse, right? know smoking bad
us will take years off life expectancy. - [Andrew] Absolutely. - smokers
high level, like smokers taking fish oil eating fish whatever
get 8%, life expectancy non-
smokers low Omega-3 Index. - [Andrew] Wow. - Right? - Wow. amazing.
also amazing people still smoke cigarettes. see lot people
vaping, know lot people consume cannabis. studies
specifically vaping people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause
mortality. - haven't seen those. haven't seen those. - not motivated enough
come research subjects. was, again, poor joke. hard study people,


marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

marijuana use, unless, told colleagues study stuff, unless offer
people marijuana, case it. But, again, actually not good
research subjects seriousness 'cause not motivated consistent,
forget appointments. incredible. mentioned data
pollution related plant compounds earlier. almost like things are,
again, acting reparative way. - omega-3s are, mean, resolving
inflammation. blunting inflammation. many different.
affect many different parts inflammatory pathway, is, think, plays huge
role way age, way brain ages, way feel, mood, joints,
that. amazing not, know.

00:59:24 Tool 4: Food Sources EPA Omega-3s

- love fish oil. feel better take it. try eat fatty fish couple times
week. want just touch food sources moment. First all, plants
rich omega-3s? second, friends really meat.
like meat lot, dad's Argentine, don't eat much it. try eat high
quality meats relatively limited amounts, eat pretty often. told
sources questionable authority that, animal grazes really good
grasses, instance, meat can contain lot omega-3s, which, principle,
makes sense based Omega-3 Index. 'Cause telling lot
omega-3 sequestered red blood cells. So, eating high quality, grass-fed
meat grasses omega-3s, steaks omega-3s no? -
study published compared conventional meat, meat animals fed
corn soy whatever is. - terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - animals
people, far can tell. sure get attacks, okay. won't read
comments. Again, joke. read comments. seems
animals either taking fish oil eat plants rich omega-3s
order meat actually contain sufficient omega-3s. - meat, comparing
conventional meat grass-fed pasture-raised cows cattle, higher
levels alpha-linolenic acid. ALA, can converted EPA DHA,
conversion inefficient dependent variety factors, including
genetics. Genetics, huge regulator. people can much better. Others,
getting like 5% conversion EPA. Estrogen major regulator making


efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely

efficient. makes sense pregnancy, estrogen just goes
roof. omega-3 fatty acids play important role brain development. Women
supposed converting ALA can longer-chain omega-3 fatty
acids. estrogen affect that, say plant sources. So, looking
ALA, plant sources walnuts, flaxseeds. probably highest.
But, person vegan vegetarian, best bet actually get microalgae oil.
can supplement microalgae oil microalgae, make
DHA. better source people vegetarian vegan
rather flaxseed oil conversion inefficiency, enzymes
convert ALA EPA DHA, again, inefficient. - then, people eat fish,
sardines, said. - [Rhonda] Salmon. - Salmon, eat skin,
understand. - don't to, good. - [Andrew] rich omegas. - oil,
yeah. reason say, think best wild Alaskan salmon versus
farm-raised farm-raised, again, feeding 'em corn. feeding
'em grain stuff. - [Andrew] Really? - then, give 'em astaxanthin.
astaxanthin carotenoid. carotenoid things like krill, crustaceans
make red pigment. - Yeah, also used now supplement,
prescription form try rescue age-related vision loss role
vitamin pathway photoreceptors. - Yeah, well, actually carotinoids
themselves, like lutein, zeaxathin, really good sequestering singlet oxygen,
damaging, right? - Yeah, age, retinal cells, cells
eye metabolically active, accumulate lot reactive oxygen species,
mitochondrial repair limiting reactive oxygen species major theme trying
rescue vision. whole podcast story. really interesting
data now use red light try trigger pathways. - seen some.
good friend many years amazing scientist Glen Jeffery's lab
University College London. talk point, not today. - saw
study, like 2020, it? - Now, second study. - Oh, they?
done, okay. - looking real. - [Rhonda] exciting. - mean, cautious.
appropriately British cautious it. always joke studies
done here, everyone already know it. Glen conservative
guy, done stuff now pigs, rodent models, now also two studies
humans. looking pretty interesting. sardines also anchovies. way,
hate food items describing. can barely tolerate salmon. don't like fish


all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

all. Actually, like live fish. - fish oil's good you. - fish tanks kid.
No, find fish, unless sushi form, find absolutely repulsive, don't know
why. probably mutation. - raw fish actually higher mercury
cooked. - Okay, well, good. don't really like sushi much anyway.
giving great reasons not eat fish, except eat fish sources
supplement heavily. message getting. - eat sardines. Every day,
first meal almost can sardines avocado. - Avocado good. - love it,
yeah, little bit lemon little hot sauce. - avocado
omega-3s? - Avocado good monounsaturated fat. not really high
polyunsaturated fat. Omega-3, really, either DHA EPA marine
sources fish, plant ALA source, flaxseed walnuts. -
rough. mean, companies now making plant-based products
taste like meat. wish just make fish tastes like steak,
that's- - fish come albino, ones farm raise, don't eat
the- - joking. don't want genetically modified fish tastes like steak.
Although, love taste steak. point that, one doesn't see
regularly consuming fish sources omega-3s,

01:06:07 Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing

seems way really get supplementation. -
supplementation good way get high dose. get back dose point,
couple studies that, basically, think way showed
people 4% Omega-3 Index range, order get 8%, five-
year increased life expectancy comparing two groups, supplement
least two grams. two grams day. think little bit less
triglyceride form, think two grams good, safe number.
Americans not eating lot fish not supplementing probably
around 4 5% Omega-3 Index. get 8%. think good
empirical way thinking it, right? Okay, well, want get 8%. way,
almost 16% Omega-3 Index. - Yeah, going ask testing. So,
can somebody measure Omega-3 Index? Which, again, just remind people,
essentially percentage omega-3s blood caveat
Omega-3 Index will heavily biased ate previous days. -


Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

Not Omega-3 Index. Okay, so, Omega-3- - Sorry, misunderstood. thought
said, red blood cells, ate salmon two days ago, Omega-3 Index going go
up. - No, plasma. - [Andrew] misunderstood. - people measuring,
look lot studies, honestly, Andrew, think lot reason
conflicting data people measuring plasma omega-3 levels. - [Andrew]
Okay. - phospholipids. phospholipid, right? phospholipids carrying
things. lipoproteins. carrying things like omega-3 triglycerides
stuff shuttling 'em around. Omega-3 Index actually red blood cells,
red blood cells take 120 days turn over. So, going baseline test,
want know supplementing level is, wait 120 days
second test supplementing know much went
long takes red blood cell turn over. Omega-3 Index. Bill
Harris company co-founded. called OmegaQuant, measure
Omega-3 Index. variety different index tests. can basic one
little advanced. - blood draw. - little blood spot thing, yeah.
uses money funnel back lipid research.
sorts interesting studies omega-3s, great. Omega-3 Index great.
think that, honestly, people researchers using
conflicting data, always comes measuring, sensitivity it.
even measuring anything? giving someone 500 milligrams DHA,
don't see effect. Well, measure levels were?
measure Omega-3 Index? sorts problems randomized controlled
trials, think need to, scientists, need come together make
progress. mean, know? talk other. figure things out.
test there. used. used not just Bill's group,
everyone. - Yeah, well, learning much you. agree need
collaboration. always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations lab Stanford.
Collaborating just much fun. Online, seems bias towards
creating silos opposed bridges, appreciate bring need
collaboration. knowing measures best, and, case, now, thank
clarification, understand Omega-3 Index going best. So,
basically, now, look you, think, 16% omega-3. - dolphins
19%. almost- - goal? trying get there. - is. [laughs] -
Interesting. Actually, probably something trying achieve


omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

omega-3 ratio favorite species. Now covered bit get
things

01:10:22 Benefits Omega-3s

one system, depending one eats, et cetera, better
measurements, omega-3 related lipids,
positive effects? mind, incredibly elementary,
understanding that, level, making platelets slippery. true
not? happy wrong. possibly impacting mood?
synthesis membrane neurons allows neurons release transmitter, like
serotonin dopamine? purported, reported, known
mechanisms? - think well-known mechanisms
omega-3 fatty acids powerful regulators inflammatory process
way, shape, form, whether resolvins produced
metabolites DHA, example. Resolvins play role resolving inflammation.
want inflammatory response activated supposed be, want
resolve inflammation inflammatory response timely manner, right?
resolvins help that. resolvins one, specialized
pro-mediating molecules, SPMs, also help resolve inflammation. There's,
like mentioned, leukotrienes prostaglandins, things
affected EPA, affect platelets platelet aggregation, affect
whole pathway well. think just many different ways inputs.
so, talk inflammation, honestly, big general term,
talking serotonin release level neurons, know inflammatory
molecules cross blood-brain barrier. just mentioned ago injecting people
lipopolysaccharide causing depressive symptoms. known omega-3,
actually specifically EPA, able help serotonin. Inflammation inhibits release
serotonin, EPA actually able blunt inflammatory responses along DHA
well. DHA resolvins stuff. helps serotonin
released not much inflammation getting brain
affecting serotonin release, right? one mechanism. then, another be,
well, DHA shown, important fatty acid makes cell
membranes, many cell membranes, including neurons. And, well


know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

know, Andrew, structure function receptors transporters, membrane-
bound proteins surface cells, including neurons, affected
membrane fluidity, like rigid fluid cell membrane is, DHA plays
role that. so, example, animal studies, make animal deficient
DHA, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, affected
structure affected fluidity membrane. think
another mechanism. talking sort general 'cause not neuroscientist. - No,
makes perfect sense. know, instance, neuroplasticity almost always
involves recruitment receptors improvement feature
receptors neurotransmitters. literally move laterally membrane.
kind float around like little rafts. Sometimes are, fact, lipid rafts. makes
perfect sense molecules like DHA, part structural fat
neuron, because, course, outsides neurons basically fat, not just myelin
people heard of, actual membranes, getting right, wouldn't
want rigid concrete, wouldn't want soft as... Need come
something here. gooey stuff kids play with? like goo. Anyway. -
Oh, yeah. - Yeah, disgusting, soft membrane neuron. -
get machines, like claw machines. - Someone put comments
tell disgusting gooey stuff is. don't want neurons gooey,
yet don't want like concrete either. - balance. Yeah. -
balance.

01:14:40 Tool 5: Food Sources DHA Omega-3s

And, mentioning DHA, realize backtracking, want make sure close
hatches people. talked lot EPA, food sources DHA
find particularly attractive, either taste potency DHA, just
throw out? aware supplements can
get nice ratio EPA DHA, take separately, do. want
make sure getting enough DHA, need sure eating
regular basis? - Well, fish packaging DHA EPA ratio, also
eat salmon roe, salty, really high source
phosphatidylcholine DHA talked about. - fish eggs. - is, actually-
- [Andrew] like reason. - Oh, you? - Yeah, discovering


something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

something myself. not meant nutritional psychotherapy,
anyway. discovering that, yeah, like eating embryonic fish. just
don't like eating actual fish. - Okay, well. - Okay, fish eggs okay. caviar,
basically. - Caviar, yes. good source phospholipid form.
consuming lot wanted get phospholipid form. - [Andrew] Yum! -
actually really good. animal studies piglets rodents
well showing consuming phospholipid DHA fetal brain development gets like
10 times DHA brain. Again, it's- - Makes sense based fetal development.
So, need buy beluga caviar? Stuff can get pretty expensive $200 tin. - don't
think need to. think matter preference. supplementing
two four grams fish oil, mean, going get phospholipid form anyway
'cause body's going make it. - Okay, seen containers assume
quality fish eggs not caviar level can find better
grocery stores aren't super expensive. - [Rhonda] Right. - wouldn't dip low
go eat, instance, like fishing bait. Like, kids, used go fishing,
put fish egg thing. probably not good. - No. - Although good
enough fish apparently. Okay. half joking here, folks. just trying protect
yourselves. Don't get crazy ideas eating fishing bait. Okay,
great know. plant-based compounds,

01:17:07 Vitamin D & Sun Skin Exposure

omega-3s, EPA, DHA, mentioned third category.
place third category foods supplement-based nutrients
health, brain and/or body health, can really benefit from? - mean, think
obvious vitamin D, actually, know, steroid hormone
produce sun. Depending time year, can make
skin. depending much melanin skin, whether not
wearing sunscreen old are, sliding scale efficient
process is. - understand, inverse relationship, darker skin
naturally, vitamin D need consume. right? - Well, darker
skin is, harder is. study University Chicago,
several years ago, looked African Americans compared African
Americans Caucasians light skin, fair skin, well make vitamin


D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

D sun exposure, long sun make X amount.
turns African Americans darker pigmentation, protects
burning rays sun, natural sunscreen, stay sun six times long
someone none natural sunscreen. think take-home lot
people darker skin living Sub-Saharan Africa, people living India
darker skin, Philippines, know, equatorial regions tend
see darker skin protection burning rays sun. - adaptation.
- sun more, getting vitamin D, people maybe
moved United States, like Minnesota, place UVB radiation isn't getting
atmosphere 12 months year. getting four months,
example. even living modern day society, people just don't go outside
anymore. mean, inside. laptops school. work.
cubicle, whatever. supplementation play major role, not people
darker skin aren't outside time, everyone. 70% US
population inadequate vitamin D levels. 70 whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. -
everyone. think insufficient levels defined less 30
nanograms per milliliter, defined Endocrine Society, looking lot
different aggregate studies, all-cause mortality, example. lot
different meta analyses all-cause mortality studies, vitamin D levels really seem
ideal 40 60 nanograms per milliliter. so, order get level,
not outside time, live Southern California, always
outside without sunscreen on. always wear sunscreen trying protect
skin many wrinkles stuff, also skin cancer somewhat issue
well. So, basically, point vitamin D steroid hormone, meaning actually
binds receptor another receptor dimerizes it, retinoid receptor,
complex goes nucleus cell, DNA is, recognizes little
sequences DNA called vitamin D response elements. called VDREs.
specific sequences DNA complex, vitamin D bound vitamin D
receptor, goes inside recognizes turns whole host genes, turns off
whole host genes. mean, important stuff. Imagine 70% population
insufficient testosterone, right? steroid hormone. - might headed
there, probably not. No, think names important, think one
issues vitamin D called vitamin D. not called DHEA variant blah, blah,
blah. doesn't sound like hormone. glad mentioning skin major


interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

interface environment vitamin D synthesis lot people think
skin just protective sheath around us something adorn
earrings tattoos whatever, skin obviously serves roles, skin
endocrine organ. capacity make things impact hormones make
hormones. beautiful study last year. took place Israel,
people get outside 20 30 minutes day, three times week,
exposing culturally acceptable yet substantial amount skin time,
saw big increases testosterone estrogen. keratinocyte-linked
pathway involving p53. done humans, knockout studies
parallel. study told reminded skin endocrine organ.
idea sun trigger activation

01:22:18 Role Vitamin D, Gene Regulation

production hormone really interesting makes total sense. So, vitamin
D gets cells, binding VDR - [Rhonda] Es. - Es, sorts things
triggering? So, testosterone, know going trigger protein synthesis,
muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, estrogen, going keep neurons
going, joints feeling good. always remind people that, way, 'cause guys
always seem want increase testosterone reduce estrogen. Just
remind people, reduce estrogen, guys, libido will plummet near zero.
Don't crush estrogen. It'll also make stupid. not already stupid, will
make stupid. estrogen's vitally important males females. vitamin D
gets cells, sorts things stimulating? - Okay, so, first all, regulating
5% protein-encoded human genome. say because,
looking data really depth starting 2012 2014, that,
now grown. one important things find interesting published
back 2014 gone big, published database, someone
published genes found VDREs in, basically found
tryptophan hydroxylase-1 tryptophan hydroxylase-2 there.
started looking sequence, silico work, turns
VDREs tryptophan hydroxylase-2. So, people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase
enzyme converts tryptophan serotonin. tryptophan amino acid
get food. convert tryptophan serotonin gut, also


brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

brain. However, serotonin not cross blood-brain barrier.
tryptophan get brain, convert serotonin
brain. Well, enzyme brain called tryptophan hydroxylase-2,
activated vitamin D. one gut actually tryptophan hydroxylase-1.
published work hypothesized might actually repressed vitamin
D sequence. sequence itself, 12 nucleotide sequence, can
determine, degree, whether going activated turned off.
able kind look think, oh, maybe that. Since then,
groups confirmed vivo and/or vitro studies. Mine
silico stuff, anyways. serotonin, really important one.
regulating immune cell, immune system. regulating blood pressure.
water retention. Bone, course, homeostasis. 5%. 5%. can't tell you. Like,
much. - 70% US population deficient,

01:25:30 Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing & Vitamin D3 Supplementation

beginning think linchpin number really important
issues. supplementing vitamin D3 normally hear. do. think end taking
5,000 IUs, sometimes 10 IUs vitamin D3 per day. Just done long time,
levels tested range. family member, just
mention this. family member not feeling well, just kind feeling off,
little low, digestive issues, went long period time, taking,
recommendation, 15,000 IUs D3 still deficient D3. Now takes,
not suggesting anyone this. special case, perhaps, no chronic illness
aware of. Needs take 30,000 IUs per day order bring D3 range
just normal, which, me, striking eat quite well, healthy
weight, et cetera, made tremendous difference terms mood. Now,
course, correlative. Now feel better. it. knows?
probably also getting outside more. think people need get tested. need
get D3 levels tested. good starting range people
think D3 supplementation, and, again, foods can increase D3? - vitamin
D3 good way supplement it. Vitamin D2 plant source. often
find fortified foods like milk, usually D2. - anyone still drink milk besides kids? -
here, like can't find cows milk. - [Rhonda] mean, lattes


getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. one? - [Rhonda] fortified
well. - Oh, are. Okay. - [Rhonda] are, yeah. fortified in- -
hard time finding cows milk. - Almond milk oat milk stuff, yeah.
stuff. Vitamin D naturally degree fatty fish. think cod liver
oil, right? vitamin D, not going correct deficiency eating fish
vitamin D. either going correct sun exposure, right
area, right amount sun, right age, because, get old,
become inefficient converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 skin. -
Well, probably going 'cause person getting
age. - lot single nucleotide polymorphisms. talked APOE4
previously, variety genes people have, common, actually.
fact, many people done exact thing. measuring
vitamin D levels supplementation way going figure
out, right? important. don't measure it, don't know. can't know
don't measure. variety SNPs basically make
conversion inefficient. And, fact, there've lot Mendelian randomization
studies. studies scientists will look commons SNPs, people
common variations gene. 1% population.
not random mutation. actually found sizeable percent population.
then, looked various outcomes. lot times, look genes
also involved kind lifestyle factor, vitamin D, SNPs basically
make conversion either vitamin D precursor D3, D3 25-hydroxy vitamin
D, active steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
variety different SNPs show. not looking vitamin D levels all.
looking just SNPs. know, it, low vitamin D.
really way beautifully randomized controlled trial
observational study not biased. Vitamin D levels also associated
health. People higher vitamin D either outside more,
physically active, aware health supplementing, right?
always worry observational study. Dealing
randomization beautiful reason, now just random. People
randomly genes, no health status. SNP, like
friend, like family member healthy all. healthy, yet
couldn't get D levels up, right? Mendelian randomization studies


found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

found people can't convert precursor, 25-hydroxy vitamin D,
usually measured. stable form vitamin D body.
higher all-cause mortality, can't it. people don't lower
all-cause mortality. higher respiratory-related mortality. higher
cancer-related mortality. So, me... Now, get rant? Oh,
family member. So, basically, also likely get multiple sclerosis.
done Mendelian randomization. really hammer home
importance measuring vitamin D levels proactive that.
mean, can get done anywhere. doctor will it. ask 'em it,
know. supplementation wise, typically, don't one SNPs,
part, taking 1,000 IUs vitamin D will raise blood levels around five nanograms
per milliliter. say deficient, 20 nanograms per milliliter,
want get 40. going need least 4,000 IUs, normal don't
SNPs change metabolism vitamin D, right? -
matter take relative sun exposure, time day, without food? -
seen not great preliminary evidence suggesting maybe time day important.
don't think it. Like, can't seem find anything really suggests.
actually converted hormone, mean, stored. - slow-acting.
steroid hormones slow-acting. - Yeah, not like immediate thing. maybe
get new data like otherwise, just don't, yeah. - simplifies problem
anyway. So, people going stubborn not get D3 levels tested
D levels tested, simply say, "Oh, just take D3." me,
way, got tested. threw 5,000 IUs mix figured, well, not going kill
me. It'll bring vitamin D levels up. realize bit coarse way approach it,
feel fine, still breathing ambulatory. So, reasonable? 1,000
5,000 IUs people will reasonably safe. Again, just assuming people
going just jump without blood test. - course, think that, look
literature, scientific literature, extremely hard get hypercalcemia,
major concern really high levels vitamin D3 supplementation. mean,
talking like hundreds thousands IU day long time. - Hundreds
thousands. - Yes, yes. Now, upper tolerable intake set Medicine Institute
4,000. kind like one things safe. personally take 5,000
IUs day well, levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mill. don't put
sunscreen time. put face wear hat, skin


exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

exposed, make sun well.

01:33:15 Tool 7: Skin Surface Area & Sun Exposure, Vitamin D

- glad brought fact keep arms exposed. Because,
studies mentioned before, looking sun exposure skin increases
hormones, testosterone, estrogen, mainly, became clear looking data
amount skin expose important, makes perfect sense
hear that, think people thinking, oh, sun,
wearing shorts t-shirt, wearing sweatshirt hoodie?
covered sun? Well, might great setting circadian rhythm
way light eyes 'cause primary mechanism that. seems
body surface can safely appropriately, please,
folks, appropriately expose sun, vitamin D going create.
laying back deck shorts t-shirt arms exposed legs exposed
different stimulus walking around jeans sweatshirt. - Absolutely. -
Right? Okay, okay. Especially sunscreen face. know almost
seems like trivially simple,

01:34:23 Vitamin D & Longevity

not sure people used thinking skin interface create
hormones. - Yeah. - surface area matters. - way,
studies looking people deficient vitamin D. case, African
Americans given 4,000 IU day vitamin D supplement bring back
sufficient levels. smaller study like, reversed
epigenetic aging three years. Because, again, hormone. regulating
5% protein-encoding human genome. studies looking
vitamin D receptor knockout mice. use lot presentations
talking vitamin D longevity. look animals, vitamin D
receptor, mentioned earlier, vitamin D binds receptor, complexes
retinoid receptor, go nucleus complex turn
turn off genes. Well, get rid receptor, can animal
studies, can determine effects will no vitamin D. Like,


study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

study no vitamin D? found animals, and, fact, don't
think complete knockout 'cause think might embryonic lethal, but- -
[Andrew] hypomorph. - Yes. - basically geek speak gene vastly
reduced function, number function, number, people know mean, isn't
eliminated completely. - Right, well, animals, look age
four months, mean, mice look like. mean, accelerated aging.
wrinkled. no hair. lifespan's shorter. mean, can look animal
not know anything mice work like, "That animal looks like
it's..." course, mice lifespans like two, two half years, but, like, 500
years old. - Looks like went graduate school twice. - [Rhonda] Yeah. - Actually,
graduate school's lot fun. like think aged backwards graduate school,
not true. look photos. definitely aged forward. You, hand, look
exactly way 10 years ago. not saying flatter you,
absolutely true. mean, data data. remarkable. definitely going try
get omega-3 percentage there. not going hinge that,

01:36:46 Sun Exposure & Sunscreen

clearly lot things right. So, taking vitamin D3, still need get
sun. Correct? - Absolutely. - Okay, think lot people don't know that, or,
least, family members little bit resistant. Like, "I take
vitamin D "so don't need get outside much." think people really afraid
getting sun worried melanomas. And, honest,
scared sunscreen melanoma. things sunscreen
really spooky, mainly compound. here, not one conspiracy. drink
tap water. Listen, folks. People cringe, drink tap water. occasional
croissant donut. 90%, 80% time, right things, right way, think.
Although, now going improve new knowledge. don't like
see sunscreens. Because, look compounds, cross
blood-brain barrier. don't want compounds crossing blood-brain barrier. - Titanium
dioxide? - Dioxide, triclosans also cleansers. mean,
know little bit neurons, folks, realize neurons got basically
ones got entire life. reason blood-brain
barrier, blood-ovary, blood-testes barrier. genetic material


resides testes, ovaries, brain. neurons don't turn over.
new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.
comes sunscreen, freaks compounds go
transdermal cross blood-brain barrier, like keep
neurons free stuff. Anyway, speculating now. - Wear hat. - Wear hat,
get sun get D3 levels up. Okay, so, talked plant-
based compounds, omega-3s, D3. Unless something else just
absolutely must throw mix, probably will return us conversation
opened with, cold heat, which, admittedly, pulled us off
path,



01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

new neurons not many unless mouse, frankly.
protecting key, lot things sunscreen downright
dangerous. think sunscreens safe, hard figure
sunscreens free compounds. amazed still
market, frankly. - always geared towards ones minerals
reflecting it. somewhat difficult penetrate things way skin
get bloodstream, don't know. Maybe compounds get
easily. seen evidence things. - Yeah,
evidence go transdermal. - get in. Okay, well, know
react sun and, protect UVA and/or B, form massive
reactive oxygen species carcinogen. mean, like thing trying
protect might actually cause- - [Andrew] Right. - don't know.
completely speculation. is, think, evidence coming
compounds. can't remember 'em off top head, lot
high-end ones also have. chemical sunscreen ones. - Right, right. - [Rhonda]
chemical ones. - proposing journal club. journal club, folks,
academics get together. Well, read papers, get together, pick
apart papers. strong correlation early graduate student
critical. 'Cause actually published papers,
realize that, studies, people best within context can
do. it'd great journal club point sunscreens 'cause love
really figure compounds. People using like crazy.
not one people like, oh, won't use commercial toothpaste anything
like that. Like said, drink tap water. use commercial toothpaste, whatever.

01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

01:40:30 Role Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables

take full responsibility that. that, just want offer
opportunity. anything supplement-based food-based compounds
think especially useful brain and/or body health? - think magnesium
important well. mean, think, again, 40% US population doesn't
get enough magnesium. essential mineral supposed getting
diet. - Involved everything. - is. also involved vitamin D metabolism. And,
fact, deficient magnesium may make difficult actually make
vitamin D hormone, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D. one factors, again,
talked genetics, also magnesium status well. Considering 40%,
big number. Now, magnesium's also involved making ATP, energetic
currency cells. Basically, cells need ATP anything. also involved
utilizing ATP well DNA repair enzymes. enzymes involved
repairing damage DNA. personally think magnesium insufficiency causes
insidious type damage daily can't look mirror see.
deficient vitamin C, like, "My gums falling apart. "I scurvy, right?"
can't see DNA damage. can't see it, happening. happening right now
body, happening body. happening. Normal metabolism
happening every day. repair damage. repair enzymes body
called DNA repair enzymes. require magnesium. Magnesium co-factor
them. means, co-factor means, enzymes need function properly,
so, without co-factor, not properly. way like think
magnesium. easy. 'Cause people go, "What food eat?" Naturally,
next question. Well, magnesium center chlorophyll molecule. Chlorophyll
gives plants green color. dark, leafy greens high magnesium.
Basically, 40% insufficiency US tell us? People aren't eating
greens. not eating greens. eating packaged food.
eating processed food. standard American diet isn't really high dark, leafy
greens. dark, leafy greens like get magnesium. think comes along
important. mean, get calcium them. get vitamin K1.
getting lot micronutrients, getting compounds
don't know about, ones know about, like sulforaphane, right? -
broccoli, need eat dark, leafy greens raw? And, case, little


open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

open actually like taste of, dare say, kale. kale's dark, leafy
green, right? - Yes, high lutein zeaxanthin well. - trichromat,
meaning not color blind, just want make sure falls strict category.
'Cause every while, like, "Oh, eat vegetables." like avocados,
people remind avocados not vegetable. love vegetables also. kale,
examples? - Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard,
romaine lettuce. - bitterness important component this? - magnesium,
no, sulforaphane, cruciferous vegetables. brassica family.
question cooking them. magnesium, bound food matrix,
can somewhat less bioavailable. cooking can somewhat release
magnesium, goes water too. either steam kind like
get water in. - can drink water. - Yeah, personally don't worry it. -
Okay, great. - [Rhonda] just don't worry. - Well, don't worry, not going
worry. - also supplement magnesium. supplementation
magnesium, mean, go on. keep short sweet
going get back stuff.

01:44:50 Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate

can cause GI distress high doses. personally like take around 130 135
milligrams. way, not like huge bolus gut. - think depends
form magnesium too. - Yes, yeah. mean, can take magnesium threonate,
example, doesn't affect gut much. - Magnesium citrate. - Citrate
take. - [Rhonda] take Thorne. - pretty potent gut stimulus. feel like little bit
harder digest. - 135 milligrams pretty good. citrate, actually, oh boy,
want go here? - mean, you. don't to. Personally,
supplementing magnesium long time. use threonate bisglycinate
malate different reasons. So, yes, love go willing. -
say malate best, short-chain fatty acids
good gut lot work done former colleague mine good friend,
Mark Shigenaga, showing short-chain fatty acid, citrate, malate, lactate,
specifically malate, really, lactate major ones get gut epithelial
cells energy source mitochondria goblet cells, anyways,
whole topic. - okay. take malate told helpful.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

Huberman Lab Podcast. Thank you, again, joining discussion
Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


First all, doesn't make sleepy like forms magnesium,
act mild sedative me. tap GABAergic pathway,
neurotransmitter, folks, that, general, broad sweeping generalization here, can
somewhat sedative quality, take magnesium threonate and/or
bisglycinate sleep, 30 60 minutes sleep. Definitely enhances
transition time sleep depth sleep. No question, experience.
data threonate can neuroprotective, although studies still
ongoing. getting sense maybe little skeptical am.
- Yeah, no, seen studies threonate. think, looking actual data
one clinical study, wasn't statistical significance three pieces
data pulled together, really just sample size
small, right? - Yeah, thinking paired the, work- - [Rhonda]
animal stuff. - Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. getting kind inside ball
neuroscience. quality labs matters, folks, something not
accessible people outside fields. Guosong Liu folks
time MIT, think highly work. animal studies indeed just
animal studies, pretty impressed studies.
pioneering think done 10, 12, 15 years ago. then, yes,
need human clinical data. But, me, figured that, given safety profile
mag threonate, given helps sleep better, sleeping better just better
everything, frankly. take it. bisglycinate threonate seem
somewhat interchangeable, don't know reports bisglycinate can
neuroprotective. malate take daytime. me, and, again,
subjective, tangible effect improving recovery time exercise. don't
know sore workout since started taking malate, used get
sore even kind trivial workouts. don't know going there,
keep taking it. - Malate, again, short-chain fatty acid, intense
exercise, release endotoxin gut. just going back interesting work
'cause malate short-chain fatty acid Mark Shigenaga showing,
animal research way, feeding animals malate. really
protected gut, endotoxin release, affected metabolic syndrome sorts
things. think malates awesome, always try eat green apples. really
high malic acid. - [Andrew] Oh, good know. - tart cherries. Tart cherries
really high well. - also taste really good. - really interested


magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

magnesium threonate stuff. take supplement called Magnesi-Om Moon Juice.
like little powder. got little bit monk fruit, tastes good. little
bit bedtime well. Probably several hours though don't like
drink tons tons fluids go bed. magnesium threonate,
variety versions magnesium well, really like it. thought
magnesium threonate stuff super interesting. love see clinical data
well, think, get it, it'll probably like, oh yeah, getting brain,
awesome, so, know, wait? - along lines, put post
said, feel like number different categories health information
consumers online understanding one topic can alleviate
lot strain stress finding information. people
perfectly comfortable data mouse study. like, "If done mice, great.
try it." people say, "No, done humans." Double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies. Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. Then, people just say,
"You know what? "I don't even care that. "Just tell do."
then, people say, "You know what? "I don't even care do. Just tell
do." then, category are, pill form powder
form, take it. think lot battles people picking apart people's
posts things fact people don't realize people
showing table one combination stances. know people
will try anything, know people won't take anything. idea
create array possibilities people, think animal data
impressive. back talk- - take hope of,
feel like animal data promising. - Right, go. - like,
probably is, not?

01:50:57 Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol & Mood/Anxiety

- Well, obviously things right. cold heat converge
common pathways related called intermittent challenge, love. think,
intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, mean, maybe even intermittent sleep
deprivation. keep waiting intermittent sleep deprivation movement. will say,
pull all-nighters per year just work demands procrastination deadlines.
worst combination academic 'cause procrastinator


perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

perfectionist, end pulling all-nighters. sleep get next night
pretty amazing. must say, sleep gods, don't recommend anyone use
sleep deprivation that. imagine also evolved
sleepless nights. idea intermittent challenge really attractive one,
want make sure credit phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit
Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - published,
used that- - used words. - Oh, phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. make
sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, love xenohormesis. one
publications many years ago, just love it. Brilliant. brilliant term. Mark
Mattson gets credit. - Harvard guys pretty smart. mean, good school,
guess. course good school. will credit appropriate people. Thank
clarification. talked lot use call deliberate cold
exposure, distinguish cold might just accidentally exposed to,
sort obvious say cold exposure. amazing data
cold. day saw post you, included talks before.
not know learned you, credit you, even 20 seconds
immersion in, think, four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit.
Okay, translating Celsius, 49 degree Fahrenheit water, cold water, can
lead long-lasting increases epinephrine, adrenaline, presume
neuromodulators neurochemicals well. cold protocols
find particularly interesting attractive standpoint of, dunno, pick
favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, course,
weaves back metabolism. entire episode cold,
love know is, sort activity stimulus think reasonable
particularly potent one use terms cold? - So, today, three minutes 49
degrees Fahrenheit. cold tub. - get neck? - Well, try.
keep floating up. like really hard. say maybe shoulder. mean,
really floating up. telling husband. like, "There's much water
me." - much salt there? like Dead Sea float top?
- salt there? don't know. takes care stuff that, know.
Plunge. - way, podcast sponsored Plunge. give one.
thing fantastic. Also, 'cause circulates water. - does. - makes sure
break thermal layer, even colder. - even colder. sucks!
Anyways, look, honest here. wish cold do. cold


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

Huberman Lab Podcast. Thank you, again, joining discussion
Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


going go podcast. definitely cold going podcast,
going give talk anxious. need make ritual. love
sauna. hate cold. hate it, unless summertime. lot easier get
cold summertime. love cold feel after.
feel less anxious. feel good. feel focused, usually
type public speaking, just anxious, just get there. 20
seconds 49 degrees, think 49 degrees Fahrenheit really good number
time temperature, time, duration, guess, better word,
temperature matter, can 20 seconds colder temperature,
prefer, can minute longer warmer temperature. think
another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit one hour like two three,
wants one hour 59? - Yeah, familiar study. really reveals just
absolutely nerdy maybe times relationships life
challenged. love reading method sections papers. people can come
number things papers, might miss something. Surely miss certain
things, like anybody does, methods relish reading methods,
paper really interesting 'cause people sit lawn chairs basically swimming
pools hour. chilly. wasn't super cold. mean 60 not. not warm,
not ice-cold obviously. hour ridiculous level. increases
dopamine massive lasted hours. mood enhancing effects
report, not imagining that. almost certainly consequence
slowly elevating significantly elevated dopamine goes hours.
almost dreamlike profile dopamine. everything else, like Adderall
Ritalin, cup coffee pre-workout drink something, going give
big spike adrenaline dopamine big crash. somehow, creates
really nice, contoured profile. whatever experiencing nicely
supported data. - Well, need get more. couple scary
experiences going hot cold. - Can explain? - Blood pressure changes,
think, basically went straight really hot jacuzzi. like 30
minutes. heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. -
[Andrew] toasty. - 30 minutes, went straight into, time,
pool, February, wintertime, 50. 50s.
cold. there, listening Simon Garfunkel, trying stay
long time, get cold, trying impress Dan 'cause stay


like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

like 15 minutes. - [Andrew] Wow. - started feel really blinkey, like low blood
pressure something, got scared, got out, couldn't stand, like
vertigo something, scared. scared. couple
times just going straight sauna it, Cold Plunge,
starting feel, like, ooh, feel little blood pressure change something. makes
sense. sauna causing vasodilation Cold Plunge cold exposure
causing vasoconstriction, like just shock system. so, now, wait.
wait like minutes going in. need kind like make cold
routine. talk science. familiar science,
norepinephrine noradrenaline, affecting brain mood. know way
do. know feel, know neurotransmitter,
released, least, rats, shown. mice? think might've rats.
multiple studies showing released cold brain. - now,
humans well. - Oh, brain, shown. - So, study, put link
this, published 2000 European Journal Physiology, big dopamine
increase. also looked epinephrine cortisol saw really. Yeah,
done. - brain. Oh- - [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - plasma, yeah.
Yes, plasma. - hard measure dopamine directly brain unless
microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, skulls intact. Fortunately,
them, unfortunately, research community, skulls intact,
couldn't measure directly brain.

01:59:22 Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 & Heat Generation

obviously, correlate there. real effect. advantage not
often not cold adapted. Now, hard anyone get
truly cold adapted. people start look forward cold. think
looking forward feeling afterward, dopamine rush. But, get cold
adapted, certainly blunts effect. - want cold adapted
means mitochondria adipose tissue perhaps even
muscle. shown. - maybe good opportunity to, cold
UCP1, educate us UCP1. find really interesting, learned
you. - Yeah, well, norepinephrine actually released plasma. act
hormone. Vasoconstriction one thing does, also regulates variety


molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

molecular functions adaption cold, one happening be, shivering
inefficient way produce heat, body's trying
exposed cold, muscles basically contracting producing heat
that, just not efficient. eloquent way it, elegant,
guess, way basically mitochondria produce tons tons heat.
way activating gene called UCP1, uncoupling protein 1.
Norepinephrine upstream that, activating it. is, essentially,
mitochondria little organelles inside cells responsible
producing energy. Usually, form adenosine triphosphate, ATP,
lets everything function inside body, neurotransmitter production
heart beating, et cetera. However, can uncouple mitochondria.
Basically, mitochondria, like little battery, have, well,
double membrane, first all, structure, negative charge
inside, positive charge inner membrane, outer
membrane inside part. - Like neuron. - Like neuron, yeah. - [Andrew] Yeah,
cool. - guess, like neuron. like battery, negative positive. Well,
basically, can uncouple charge, positive charge proton start leaking
mitochondria, mitochondria freak out. called uncoupling it.
maximum respiration, call it. try make much energy. like, "I
got get proton back, "that gradient, electrochemical gradient." just go
insane. case, uncoupled energy, energy making actually heat,
not ATP, essentially burning substrate, cares? burning glucose.
burning lipids. basically burning things making heat.
uncoupling does, much efficient way producing heat
shivering. So, become adapted, maybe longer duration
stayed cold times done it, no longer shiver anymore.

02:02:30 Tool 11: Cold & Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism

will start just uncoupling type thermogenesis, called.
another type adaptation occurs actually produce mitochondria
adipose tissue. actually happens, also regulated norepinephrine
noradrenaline, protein called PGC-1alpha. protein
makes mitochondria adipose cell. So, per adipose cell, getting


mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

mitochondria. beautiful way basically make heat. one things
like, body's going, "Okay, going exposed "to cold next time.
"How can make sure don't die? "Oh, can mitochondria, "and going
make heat." making mitochondria adipose tissue.
often referred browning fat. reason because,
look microscope lipid droplet, basically, fat cell, not lipid droplet,
adipocyte, find looks darker mitochondria there.
referred browning fat. don't want get whole beige fat, brown.
know, whole, sure experts talk that. - No, not
yet. always think white fat, beige fat, brown fat. beige kind of, white can
converted beige. - Right, beige can take thermogenic characteristics
essentially, can activate beige fat thermogenic sense
burning glucose and/or fatty acids producing heat. expose
cold, can brown fat, speak, therefore can
tolerate cold longer periods, people notice, can
thermogenic qualities brown adipose tissue beige, activated beige,
adipose tissue. get lot naysayers saying, "Oh, brown fat doesn't
regulate metabolism all." reality thousands researchers trying
pill brown fat thermogenic. trying make pill affect
metabolism. not thing. certainly, obese trying lose weight,
not going just cold exposure. need dietary
exercise changes predominantly, affect metabolism.
shown human studies, interesting, another possible mechanism
affecting metabolism,

02:05:08 Cold Exposure & High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle

adipose tissue, also make mitochondria muscle tissue.
regulated, not via norepinephrine, still PGC-1alpha, interestingly, not
anyone else really cares me, maybe do, Andrew. - eating up. -
PGC-1alpha responds norepinephrine adipose tissue make
mitochondria, but, muscle tissue, unclear regulator is. Cold exposure
it. shown least couple studies seen, people
exercising, believe, maybe may men exercising,


training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like

day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing

02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

training, cold water immersion, something like 50 degrees
Fahrenheit, 15 minutes, PGC-1alpha, biomarker mitochondrial
biogenesis, generation new mitochondria. way, awesome.
want mitochondria muscle. associated improved muscle mass,
improved endurance. Mitochondria essentially, making energy cell.
don't make mitochondria normally. certain inputs, high-intensity
interval training, exercise can it. - Can actually make mitochondria. - Yes, yeah,
shown people. - Weight training just high-intensity interval training?
- haven't seen weight training. seen high-intensity interval training, endurance
training, doesn't mean hasn't shown, just haven't seen it,
hasn't looked at. - good know. always looking reasons finally
HIT type, high-intensity interval training work. weight training, low-
intensity cardio. - brilliant study by, time, postdoc, Matthew
Robinson, now gone start lab University Oregon Health
Science Center. - [Andrew] Great place, yeah. - study young
older people, whole high-intensity protocol, can't remember
was, protocol X amount time. sure least month.
measured biomarkers mitochondrial biogenesis muscle tissue,
amount mitochondrial biogenesis old people specifically, happened
young old HIT, high-intensity interval training, was, mean,
enormous, least 50%, think. - [Andrew] Fantastic. - just like, whoa! so,
want that? Well, mitochondria, cells turning over. make new
cells. replace old ones. mitochondria, don't really
part. can. Mitochondrial biogenesis happen, stimulate
happen. happens mitochondria essentially bobbing
around inside cells, fuse mitochondria, exchange
content, mitochondrial DNA, fizz back apart. kind
stay young-ish. But, age, keep

02:08:04 Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata & Sauna

pool mitochondria, going get bunch old mitochondria
mixing old stuff together, right? So, wouldn't want bring new, healthy,
young mitochondria pool, right? So, mind, hear mitochondrial


biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting

red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

biogenesis, like, aging. first thing think of. So, anyways, cold exposure
that. things well, so. - Amazing. please, thank offering
somehow filter level detail, assure listeners podcast
familiar drinking fire hose mechanism, really helpful. And,
again, just one example maybe four five things said,
least, going inspire change behaviors. going start
high-intensity interval training. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast recently, told
subtle zone 2 cardio weight training's great, really
max heart rate work per week, going max heart rate 90 seconds,
resting repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. just curious, brief
aside, talk heat, sort cardiovascular types training
do? HIT? imagine high-intensity interval training.
just give us sense contour week relates exercise.
gracious sharing supplements food,
exercise? - depends week, course, got going
son work schedule. lot high-intensity interval Tabatas
stationary cycle. use Peloton just like instructor telling
do, competing everyone else. like, ah, know? works
me. - revealing something psychology. good. just learned
about. podcast actually just decoy psychological assessment
guest. No, kidding. So, now, know competitive. Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. -
explains lot got graduate school do.
getting Peloton, look like someone not familiar
Peloton? know are, never one. pedaling
instructor many seconds? - bunch people online,
either class time time it, can kind
toggle want, can try compete time number. -
really competitive. - [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. - instructor just to,
like, whip you. know, make you. brilliance Peloton is... used
called rush cycle. basically go group cycle instructor there,
high-intensity interval training stuff. loved
competitive aspect working harder work just
room, like without instructor anyone there, just like, gym,
gym, just stationary cycle listening podcast, something,


fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

fine groove, right? something group setting
kind holds accountable too, right? Peloton made somehow virtual.
amazing. remember back rush cycle, pandemic,
people talking Peloton class, like, "Oh, ridiculous.
that? "That's never going work. need here." then, pandemic hit
Peloton, works really well. tend least
three times week. Sometimes more, like four. 10 minute, just
10, efficient, push ass. push really hard. -
Tabata. - 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, 10 minutes. - means
pedaling like life depended it. - [Rhonda] maxing it. - lot
resistance pedals? - always resistance. like power. power.
part sitting cycling, trying go really fast, always
crank resistance up. always go give me. then, part
standing, really crank resistance up, really do,
feel glutes. - like going hill. - Yeah, exactly. break
up, time two parts. love efficiency it.
get done. people sometimes hear me, go, "10 minutes? "Oh, really? think
work?" like, look, max Tabata 10 minutes, intense. - Yeah,
people can't sprint gate airplane miss, carrying backpack.
So, think that, just described myself, sprinting airport
going, "All right, Andy Galpin, "I got 90 seconds max heart rate you, "carrying
thing." 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off, repeating 10
minutes, so, time done, cooked. - then, competitive
recovery give end, pushing max, get
numbers higher. - Great. three times week. - [Rhonda] trick. - Yeah, three
times week, always sauna preheating up, takes hour
half, get 189 degrees Fahrenheit. hop right sauna
Peloton. - elevated heart rate continues. rationale? - Yeah, literally
bunch water, get in, either read science paper,

02:13:30 Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood

prepare presentation podcast, hash things mind.
interesting something getting sauna, think stress, heat


stress it. started sauna 2009 graduate school. - early
adopter. - started every day. lived across street. lived studio
apartment Dan. lived small studio apartment, smallest apartment
ever imagine, across street YMCA, 'cause poor
graduate school, poor, poor. - recall. lived lab. - Wow, really? - But,
again, lived lab postdoc. admit, lived lab bulldog
faculty member reasons. get it. graduate student,
poor, basically. - Yes, used go sauna going lab,
started noticing was, sudden, able handle stress better, like stress
six-month setback failed experiment, crushing, top
pressure advisor pressure 'cause competitive myself,
put lot pressure myself. hard time. stressed
graduate school. sauna started really noticeably affect anxiety
ability handle stress. like, going here? started looking
literature started getting interested effects brain. And, fact,
time, friend not actually experimentally theoretically looking
opioid system. So, get sauna, release lot endorphins.
Endorphins feel-good opioids make feel good, also release
something called dynorphin. dynorphin endogenous opioid binds
receptor called kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin responsible dysphoric
feeling sauna hot, running,
exercise, feel uncomfortable. Well, think dynorphin. speaking
absolute, think is. - No, think is. mean, evidence alcoholics
symptoms withdrawal experience related dynorphin.
dynorphin known negatively impact dopamine receptor system. So, basically,
feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, feel like garbage, think
not good, friend comes in. looking
effects treating morphine heroin addiction. people using drugs,
they, basically, endorphins morphine heroin, bind receptor
brain called mu opioid receptor. And, take drugs, mu opioid
receptor becomes downregulated, need drug feel
good did. Well, endorphins also bind receptor. looking
drugs like salvinoria, salvinorin, something. Salvia
called. binds kappa opioid receptor. also makes kind feel


uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains

one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like

02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

uncomfortable. Anyways, put studies front showed basically
binding either dynorphin whatever ligand kappa opioid receptor basically
sensitizes mu opioid receptor feel-good endorphins also changes, think
also upregulates something, so, basically, lasting effect feeling good.
endorphins release later hugging someone, joke laughing
at, whatever, feel longer, right? so, anyways, respect sauna,
big sort hypothesis mine. kind publish part hypothesis
review article, wish people kind look that. That'd amazing.

02:17:45 Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline & Memory

getting at, think, was, use sauna memorize things.
way back day, still it. wanted talk
neuroscientist, something sauna. don't
know stress response. Like, emotional trigger,
remember things better, right? - Absolutely. clear known explanation
mechanism this. - So, sauna, also release norepinephrine, just like
cold. lot overlap. stressor, use remember things. Like,
going something. want go presentation, talk, podcast,
whatever. go sauna. try it, haven't already. don't
know have. - sauna Cold Plunge now, haven't tried preparing.
read books sauna evening. time insist phone
there, initially thought cook phone, also just get separation
phone screens evening, read books. challenge,
sometimes dripping sweat onto books, willing forego pages
book. idea semi-stressful environment aid learning
retention information really well substantiated. beautiful work
guy named James McGaw. don't know lab's still active, UC Irvine
while, think University Arizona well. great memory
group places, strong learning memory, places.
one really defined kind inverted, u-shaped function relationship
adrenaline memory. Basically, relaxed not stressed
enough, not going remember information. peak levels stress,
actually memory machine, least within context whatever trying


learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics

sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval

red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.

learn. describing well matches that. Then, course, tapers
off really increase adrenaline point people starting lose
autonomic function, panicking basically,

02:19:53 Sauna, Vasodilation & Alzheimer’s Dementia Risk

obviously, keeping range. thing like ask
is, sauna, course, vasodilation, perfusion blood brain
wonderful way enhance cognition. even really nice data showing
that, inhales opposed exhales, people better learning information.
Believe not, inhale, taking absorbing remembering
exhales. beautiful studies done humans, course.
can imagine vasodilation, getting perfusion blood brain, plus
little bit stress, maybe lot stress epinephrine, then, course,
going the, don't want call placebo, going context,
condition, place context it. Like, good experience remembering
something sauna once, positive association effect location real. Just
like, people go new city get robbed, like, go Cincinnati, never
Cincinnati, get robbed Cincinnati, purse gets taken wallet
gets taken, kind hate Cincinnati tourist. happen number
different cities, right? opposite also true, something good happens
someplace. imagining combination effects,
hard cold. feel like cold potent. think takes far
curve, McGaw curve. - sing songs something
there. - [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, sing songs. - afterward,
efficient learning. - am. respect sauna, vasodilation occur,
lot overlap moderate-intensity aerobic exercise heat stress.
can imagine, exercising, elevating core body
temperature. sweating. actually sauna, blood get
redistributed skin facilitate sweating, but, much like exercise, blood flow
general improved brain, muscles, everywhere. So, think, generally
speaking, studies showing sauna use associated much lower
risk dementia Alzheimer's disease. People use four seven times week
greater 60% reduction dementia Alzheimer's disease risk compared


once- - Amazing, many? Oh, sorry, didn't mean cut off. said people
use it, apologize, maybe tell us again, people use four seven
times per week have... - greater 60% reduction dementia risk
Alzheimer's disease risk compared people use one time week. People
use two three times week something like 20, little greater 20%
reduction risk. dose-dependent effect dementia risk Alzheimer's
disease risk. also profound. big link cardiovascular
system brain. Obviously, blood flow, big one, right? need get blood
brain. cardiovascular mortality, mortality cardiovascular disease.
people use, actually men. men use sauna four seven times week,
50% reduction cardiovascular related mortality compared one time week.
Again, dose-dependent manner, two three times week something like 24% lower
death cardiovascular disease. also lower sudden cardiac deaths, like
heart attack. like 60 something, greater 60% lower, men use four
seven times week versus once. Again, dose-dependent thing. thing
profound also when, again, looking methods, look data,
work Dr. Jari Laukkanen. University Eastern Finland
just one world experts sauna use, especially respect cardiovascular
health. data also shown that, look duration, time
spent sauna, mentioned temperature about, 189 degrees
Fahrenheit. Typically, go there. pretty heat adapted.
sauna sort heat stress, whether hot tub jacuzzi, become adapted.
basically start sweat lower core body temperature cool down.
sort physiological changes start happen earlier. so, stayed like 30
minutes, stayed long time. lot. listen body.
studies just talked about, duration, time spent sauna, said
50% reduction cardiovascular disease related death, shown men
sauna 11 minutes, even used four seven times
week, reduction like 8% instead 50. greater 19
minutes, like 20 minutes sweet spot, 174 degrees Fahrenheit.
saunas Finland, way, humid, put hot water, put
water hot rocks create steam, usually 10 20% humidity
Finnish sauna. studies were, say, time, going find
humidity also elevated. But, me, dose-dependent nature


duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can
actually travel hippocampus and, least animal studies, induce
proliferation neurons, growth synapses, BDNF, number downstream things,
kind makes sense, put just evolutionary story this. body
active can signal brain body still needs cognition. inactive body,
ways, depriving brain signal body doing, right?
Obviously, making conjecture, know various ocean animals
swim around period life, completely
stationary portion life, basically, brain degenerates. don't need much
nervous system not moving. think really something there,
also just letting ideas mind drift. love you, appreciate shared
protocols, think, right now, interesting time public health
information history, people just kind getting bombarded cold good,
heat gold. Cold good. Heat good. Excuse me, misspoke.
micronutrients, and, course, macronutrients important too. Today, really
enriched us description underlying mechanisms logic behind
them, also sharing really informative think people need
jumping-off place, obviously need start someplace, getting heat
adapted, et cetera, takes time. really appreciate willing share
protocols



02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting

wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really

end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good

well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.
shown. - [Andrew] Six months. - sperm motility goes sperm production
goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass

02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

duration, me, strong data causal corollary thing.
always problem observational studies, including these,
corrected whole host factors, like cholesterol, exercise, just everything,
everything sun, corrected those. And, top that,
dose-dependent nature duration, time spent sauna, frequency.
So, me, like, something's going here. - Yeah. - Plus studies,

02:25:30 Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)

intervention studies, comparing directly, head-to-head moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise stationary cycle 20 minutes sauna. Physiologically
things happen, heart rate elevates activity, blood
pressure increases activity, then, after, heart rate decreases,
resting heart rate decreases baseline, blood pressure improved, decreases
baseline. happening moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna.
So, again, sauna, heat stress, something really mimics
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, really great people can't go
run, can't even get bike, disabled people. Granted, safety
concerns. pretty mild, exist. people recent heart attack
rare kind heart disease problem. Drinking alcohol, never that.
Elderly people prone low blood pressure. Always talk physician
sauna. stressful. - Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. definitely avoided saunas
pregnant. think relevant disabled people also people
sedentary sedentary life. Like, mother, able get
sauna not. get Peloton once, really
much easier. feels like spa treatment, can listen music there.
Like, care health, mostly sedentary person. find
much easier convince get sauna get Peloton. Ideally,
both. question be, well, exercise, run, high-intensity interval
training. need get sauna? reality is, published
review Experimental Dermatology last year, guess, late last year. Basically,
cardiorespiratory fitness, marker of, marker health. Cardiorespiratory
fitness improved people exercise sauna compared exercise alone
sauna alone. So, healthy, fit people already exercising,


synergistic effect also adding sauna routine. And, me, great.
many beneficial things happening heat stress. addition
mimicking aerobic exercise, heat shock proteins talked earlier.
those, kind brings back early days science Salk
Institute Biological Studies research little nematode worms
someone else injected amyloid beta 42, peptide, 42-amino acid peptide
involved amyloid plaques found brain correlating Alzheimer's disease
brain disorders. injected muscle tissue worms. And, basically,
worms become paralyzed age aggregated proteins,
proteins aggregate. Well, heat shock proteins, one main things
basically make sure proteins inside cells maintain proper three-
dimensional structure folded right, don't, not prone
aggregating forming plaques arteries also brain. Back
worm studies doing, elevate heat shock proteins worms,
totally correct problem, no longer become paralyzed.
move around like young. So, many animal studies done looking
Alzheimer's disease, human-like Alzheimer's disease rodent, heat shock
proteins protecting it. Heat shock proteins robustly activated humans.
shown to, even 50% higher baseline levels just 30 minutes 163
degrees Fahrenheit sauna. stay activated, least, rodents, 48
hours, least. heat shock proteins around, making sure
properly taking care proteins not aggregating brains
plaques, another potential way sauna's protecting Alzheimer's
disease cardiovascular health well longevity. people
SNPs heat shock protein factor 70 that, one them, got one
parents active heat shock protein 70, live average
one year longer people don't SNP. two versions,
got one mom one dad, live average two years
longer people don't SNP. - [Andrew] Wow. - also
associated human longevity well lower organisms. can heat shock
worm fly live 15% longer. work done Gordon Lithgow Buck
Institute years years ago. So, anyways, guess getting heat
shock proteins part stress response pathway talked earlier.
also activated cold well. Cold shock activate heat shock proteins. Not


robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.

goes down, completely corrected stay sauna six months.
six months later, back normal. - Great, useful information,
sure, number people there. So, people don't access sauna,
get cold too. People always say, "What cold showers?"
always say, well, studies mainly done immersion 'cause hard
keep things controlled cold showers. just doesn't make good experiment
'cause get bigger person, less shower, doesn't make
good experiment. not good immersion, but, heat, imagine
hot bath work almost well. - Yeah, studies looking
at, example, activation heat shock proteins, also brain-derived neurotrophic factor


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.

02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome

robust. Sulforaphane activates them. Again, one reasons think
get things robust inputs. input activating
mechanisms robust different ones. crosstalk. guess it'd
accurate say overlap. also like, want get robust
them, right? do, want sauna exercise eat
broccoli sprouts stuff.

02:31:29 Insulin signaling, FOXO3 & Longevity

- super interesting. couple questions came me. One is, mentioned
SNPs, nucleotide repeats, basically genes people
less others can predict longevity sense. FOXO3
pathway? - one can. Yeah, mean, FOXO3 is, fact, go back
worm studies talking about, one first things see
eyes. can take worms that, basically decrease insulin
signaling pathway IGF-1. Worms called homologous genes,
lot similarities humans. insulin-like receptor,
IGF-1-like receptor, make something like FOXO3, have. And,
basically, decrease insulin signaling pathway, FOXO3 always active
worms, live like 100% longer. not live longer,
like young worm. mean, look thing like, "This looks like
worm just born like hours ago. "What's going on? thing's end
life." Now, side note, thing always got was, way,
discovered Cynthia Kenyon. back '90s. Honestly, not sure
anything exciting worm world since then, thought really
big finding. caveat worms go dauer. called
dauer stage happens, decrease insulin signaling stuff,
go like metabolic stasis. not eating much moving.
like, okay, well live 100% longer, go weird state, know? -
know people like this, longevity community. know are.
get last laugh 'cause dead,

02:33:22 Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths & Fertility



well fed dead, still going. So, terms many data sauna,
also just want acknowledge Finnish groups work. really
pioneering, right? think 20 years ago, long social media this,
there, there, say, measuring cortisol growth hormone
stuff people getting sauna. Very, interesting. 20
minutes seems like threshold 170 degrees Fahrenheit. times per week
seems better fewer terms all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk
according just learned you. - Four good, think, minimum
effective dose. - Four times week, combine cold. also seen
protocol, where, extreme protocol, don't recommend people right off
bat, human subjects get sauna 30 minutes, get
five, 30 minutes, get five, 30 minutes, total two hours exposure,
led massive 16-fold increases growth hormone.
seldom. sounds like protocols describing, 20 minutes done four
times per week, far reasonable people access. know people
probably desperate know, don't sauna? sauna kind
unique item, couple questions. Can people use hot baths?
appropriate warning, course. Without getting description mechanics
underlying biology, pretty obvious testes, get warm, kill
sperm. reason testes housed structure called scrotum
can move around, just be, know, biologists, just talking
realities here. So, trying conceive children keep sperm healthy, guys
probably stay warm, hot baths. - least six months.

Huberman Lab Podcast. Thank you, again, joining discussion
Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and, always, thank interest science.


increases heat stress. hot bath around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
typically studies will use temperature, actually cooler I.
crank bath hot. hot. - heat adapted. - heat adapted,
yeah. 20 minutes shoulders down, robust activation
heat shock proteins brain-derived neurotrophic factor. then, heat shock
proteins also protecting muscle atrophy, also
protein structure muscle tissue well. studies animal data
well recent human data well. local hyperthermia local heat
treatment, essentially showed protected. study
looking muscle disuse, something like local heat treatment prevented
almost 40% muscle atrophy disuse. funny 'cause used use
sauna injured stuff. go sauna. didn't know
time 'cause graduate student, knew just experiments not
losing much muscle. feel better. time, reading growth
hormone stuff back then. knew heat shock proteins, kind knew,
data wasn't around yet, now data. always felt like
wasn't losing muscle, like should've been, sauna.
literally seven days week. hardcore. - also graduate
school?

02:37:41 Tool 17: Exercise & Longevity, Osteocalcin

- Yeah, now, sauna, like bare minimum, three, try four.
depends schedule. also like long runs. Long like three miles, not
like campaigns, long. really, me, talking
earlier off camera runs, me, brain. get mind-wandering
effect, daydream think things. work problems. get
creative. come ideas. happening runs. miss
runs don't 'em, miss brain effects get it.
exercise, funny, female, think exercising stay fit
shape care figure, but, exercise, literally thinking
brain. like, "This best longevity drug is. "This right
here, Rhonda. "You're always wondering. always wanting know. "You're
wanting best." don't exercise, missing essential dose.


that, me, motivation, dopamine seeking thing looking for. Admittedly,
not enough strength training. it. to, to, to.
endurance HIT, really need add in. muscle mass
also extremely important aging well, know? fault. - Well,
brain effects really interesting. also run. try get one longer run per week
runs, without phone. don't listen podcasts. occasionally will
listen music, really try not to. also find mind solves problems. feel like
washes cobwebs, speak. brilliant prolific
neuroscientists know who've long careers. Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize
winner Columbia, comes mind work memory, used swim mile
day, now think swims half mile day, late 90s still sharp,
incredible. lab done work showing load-bearing
exercise repeated, endurance work, unlike Peloton cycling, really load-
bearing, although cycling really hard resistance, causes release
osteocalcin bones, acts endocrine way, sort like hormone, can

02:41:37 Tools 18: Red Light Sauna? Infrared Sauna? Sauna & Sweating Heavy
Metals

things teach educate people about. final question,
ask, red light sauna no red light sauna? little bit vocal
feelings none red light saunas ever got hot enough,
frustrating, feel like neither there. However, acknowledge
red light low-level light therapies now known number interesting
things. Nobel Prize 1908 phototherapy lupus, not like new
thing idea light things positive biology. But, red
light sauna? think useful? mention
number one question get sauna, red light no red light, intermediate
answer. - don't infrared sauna, sauna lights. makes
red light, don't think red light talking about. - Okay. - not
activating specific wavelength, is... - usually, range seems
helpful, and, confess, use red light panel things, 670 nanometer
720 nanometer, looks like red dim lights, dim red bright red.
idea red light can travel, photon energy can travel
deep layers dermis skin. - don't red light
sauna. don't know essential not. don't think so. Based studies
talked about, think, potential effect mitochondria interesting. think
lack really good, solid evidence humans, might just
not studied enough. usually case, perhaps. Joovv, right?
Joovv. red light panels stuff. - Joovv KOZE two
ones know, K-O-Z-E Joovv. far know, probably going insult
companies time, rather insult time just
compliment one insult one. seem excellent getting appropriate
wavelengths red light. not relationship either those. - Yeah. Well,
personally think sauna itself, heat stress. typically
question get is, infrared sauna regular sauna? differences
well. Infrared saunas. Maybe infrared saunas ones red light
talking about. Infrared saunas get around 140 degrees Fahrenheit.
So, mentioned, studies 174 degrees Fahrenheit. really


stay longer period time. However, studies coming
Japan. use infrared sauna. whole protocol. called Waon
therapy. get people infrared saunas, wrap 'em towel,
stay warm X amount. whole protocol ends like hour long, but,
again, 140 degrees Fahrenheit, infrared sauna, shown
improve variety of, like, coronary heart disease conditions, heart-related
conditions. improvements. So, obviously, evidence
infrared saunas can beneficial cardiovascular health. used infrared saunas
many times in-laws. infrared sauna. crank thing
maxed, sit hour least.
sweat lot, another thing didn't talk about. sweat heavy
metals. heavy metals excreted predominantly sweat others
urine. So, example, cadmium, like 125-fold increase cadmium
excretion sweat get sauna. Also, lead something like 17-fold
excretions higher. Another one aluminum. fourfold higher. infrared,
sweat lot too, main difference heating
body thermal radiation versus ambient air. standard sauna heater,
heater's heating air, heating up.
little bit different mechanism. prefer regular saunas. data
heat stress itself. Like, heart rate's elevating there.
feeling hot. getting cardiovascular. feeling
hot sauna. that, me, takes really long time infrared sauna, like
end. think benefits infrared.
affordable. less fire hazard. But, again, hot baths are, think, good
alternative modality heat stress compared like regular sauna. - Great,
really helpful answer. Like said, use red light, not sauna. thank
reminding us 174 degree Fahrenheit threshold mainly used
studies. covered lot territory, just want thank again. extremely
thorough extremely informative. notes always look little bit like
drawn macaque monkey no knowledge English language,
can decipher tell least 10 additions current protocols
going add. lots questions, apologize advance that.
But, behalf listeners just directly me, thank much time.
learned ton. - pleasure. Thanks on. really awesome


conversation, enjoyed lot.
