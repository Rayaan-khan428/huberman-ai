brief, deliberate cold exposure. Let give details study.
study involved 49 subjects include males females. also really
important. beautiful work Susanna, soberg colleagues, far know,
looked males. study looked males females. 19 30 years old
basically two groups. People either assigned get deliberate
coal exposure not assigned deliberate cold exposure. form
deliberate cold exposure involved one session per week cold immersion cold water
neck just give sense cold was. three degrees
Celsius translates 37 half degrees Fahrenheit. That’s pretty darn
cold, two minutes: okay, one session three degrees Celsius,
otherwise known 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit two minutes every week week.
addition, subjects five cold showers per week minimum five cold
showers per week, cold showers slightly warmer immersion
cold water condition. 10 degrees Celsius, approximately 50 degrees,
Fahrenheit still pretty cold duration cold water exposure shower
just 30 seconds. Okay. interesting me, many people don't
access cold water immersion. might not ice bath place,
can that, people access cold shower sort.
Plus, think people probably one ice bath per week find place
get cold water safely. Now point people will not
well going 37.5 degree. Fahrenheit AKA, three degrees Celsius, water.
never done anything like so, going try employ sorts
protocols used study, recommend ease
course week become somewhat adapted shock cold water

00:19:27 Water: Physical Properties & Chemistry

talk water and, start off answering question: water water
is, course, H2O. everybody knows early age, H2O means
molecule water consists two hydrogens one oxygen. Now
physical arrangement two hydrogens one oxygen turns really
important water functions body and, frankly elsewhere world
life. make peace symbol put index finger
middle finger simultaneously, fact, going recommend now, unless


using hands something else important, case later? Well,
make piece symbol look hand, pretty good
impression individual water molecule consists of, H2O two
hydrogens oxygen, piece symbol, fingers tips
fingers, rather going represent hydrogens fingers, length
fingers, going represent electron bonds oxygen palm
hand, fingers going represent oxygen Okay. Now,
what’s important that, visual impression visual image individual water
molecule polarized hydrogens one side.
one side, oxygen another what’s really important
water molecules polarized can bind one another. way
polarization - something kind learned chemistry
one point - many us forgot - maybe didn't even understand - first time
around, positives negatives attract. individual water
molecules, opportunity interact essentially bind one another
bind called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds relatively weak
bonds, so, consequence, water can change comfort information. However,
covalent bonds strong enough water actually can maintain structure
structure will vary, course depending temperature. need
know water that, indeed, consists lots individual h2os h2os can
arrange different ways temperature strong determinant
arrangement water molecules bonding one another.
fact, even spacing bonds. again, even don't
chemistry stay me, definitely understand this, water can exist
least three forms maybe four forms. know can liquid. course, That’s
really. Normally, think think water, can gas, think
steam right. So, heat up, takes uh, not semi-solid semi-liquid form.
takes property steam gas. Okay. see Steam um
breathe cold day mouth nose, see air,
water molecules condensing. bonding certain ways, based
differences temperature, inside body outside air,
course can solid. can ice. Now. Ice fascinating important
understanding Water Works, will become relevant later, think
Water Works within body well, especially different temperatures


water impact, health behavior cells important point
understand water solid state that, unlike substances water
solid state, actually less dense liquid state. just think
substances like metals, instance, solid state.
dense liquid state, so, instance, solid
state, will sink container filled liquid form. Not water. Water
interesting because, you, cool water water transitions liquid solid
still binds, is, can form bonds different molecules water,
spacing H2O. again, piece symbols hands.
bunch those, know thousand hands making piece symbols,
can bond one another, cold, bonds actually made apart
one another consequence, ice know, Floats water,
words, put simply water unusual special that, solid form ice
actually less dense liquid form That’s ice floats water now
important not just biology, life, think it,
not case water less dense solid form ice liquid form,

going no problem remainder discussion today.

00:26:32 Bonds & Water Phases, “Structured Water”

fact, will also ability understand things observed many
times over, perhaps never thought really understood, are,
instance, water certain level surface tension, instance, ever

structured water may may not relate health. Later number
people believe that, within body presence certain liquids
solids water within cells particular within interactions so-
called organelles organelles, things like mitochondria, Golgi apparatus.
fancy names. things within cells allow cells everything
make proteins traffic proteins surface cells, things like
neurotransmitters receptors, on. lot people interested
structured water relates biological function. hypothesized liked
debate rather whether not body water not just present liquid form

certain things can take place like surface tension. Keep mind surface tension
water May relate either standard bonds water fourth phase. That’s
heavily debated still, certainly know that, instance, take piece

beating aggregation water molecules particular surface seeing
two things, actually um kind fun. next time see know
aggregation, beading water itself, individual water molecules
many water molecules aggregating one location making bead water. That’s

00:34:07 Body, Cells & Water

fine good, realize almost sorts properties
water become extremely relevant thinking body actually utilizes
water - key thing temperature so-called alkalinity acidity,
Ph water turn important determinants water used
cells body. fact, will describe moment, entire sets
biological mechanisms solely devoted trying get water cells specific
ways, including specific rates use water different ways. Because,
probably heard before, mostly water, what’s kind interesting
found researching episode percentages cells bodies
purported water pretty broad range. people say 55 water.
people say 70 water, people say 95 water. exact percentage
doesn't matter much really just boils whether not person That’s
stating percentage talking much water present cells body.

00:37:37 Water Solvent, Temperature & phone. will respond soon.

now, minimum, everyone understand water particular
structure. hear H2O, can kind imagine structure
water molecules can change conformation. is, can bind water
molecules turns can bind things actually change
confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar
molecules, turning solid liquid, essentially creating called
solutes, basically um dissolving solids liquid solutions. fact,
water one best solvents planet. fact, water better dissolving many
solids acid right. That’s incredible water is, number
reasons related chemistry water. can explain that, but, transition
talking physics chemistry water water actually behaves
within body contributes health disease depending case,
important understand molecules sugar salt can hydrophilic or,
know, oil water don't mix, That’s oils lipids so-called hydrophobic.
What’s hydrophobic, just think. Ah phobic certain molecules lipids, don't
dissolve well water, intuitively understand take olive oil,
instance - put little glass water, it'll likely float beat form
little spherical amoeba-like Shapes within water That’s oil lipids
hydrophobic different substances either going hydrophilic,
is, going greater propensity interact water bind
different aspects water molecules hydrophobic less propensity

water. know intuitively well. ever tried dissolve, say big
tablespoon sugar cold water, notice grains don't dissolve
quickly take big tablespoon sugar put warm hot cup
water. That’s temperature water actually changes well
Sugar molecule able change conformation interact water molecules.
Likewise, want get something, That’s really hydrophilic aqueous

00:41:49 Water Transport Cells, Aquaporin Channels

Okay, cells body, every cell, even bones, osteoblasts
cells within bones, bone marrow, red blood cells, white
blood cells, neurons, nerve cells, liver cells, kidney cells, them,
Require water order get proper amount water cells,
basically two ways water can access cells. zoom second
ask ourselves, water actually get body? us just think? Oh,
drink water body. course, That’s main way. can also breathe
water molecules body humid air hydrate cells, is,
bringing water cells, water needs move gut
bloodstream eventually individual cells, whatever cell type.
may be, basically two ways water can access cells. first way
known long time, so-called diffusion. Now,
outside cells made fatty, stuff lipid. So, instance, neurons nerve cells
lipid bilayer, two layers fat, already know fat lipid
hydrophobic. Okay. Now turns not problem, solution water


can get across lipid barrier. Why? fact water can change
conformation lipids can change conformation just enough bonds
water bonds hydrophobic lipids can interact. Allowing
water molecule basically pass lipid, can Bond weakly
cases, not weakly lipids pushed
side. Really incredible, think it, much
hydrophobic relationship lipid water, water come
surface fatty outside cells repelled away
Just stay right surface, no good
actually need water diffuse across cell membranes, actually
double cell membrane, mentioned before, two layers, water lipids cells can
interact just enough Affinity water molecule can diffuse across cell
membrane barriers, important, diffusion water molecules across
lipid barriers outsides cells fairly slow process compared
way water accesses cells - Way water accesses cells really
something just discovered 10 years ago. fairly recent
discovery turns fundamental discovery, presence
called aquaporin channels. Aquaporin channels basically portals
membrane allow water molecules move quickly across cell membranes,
rate 1 million h2os 1 million water molecules per second way water
molecules move across cell membrane aquaporin channels
interesting, inside channels way think literally
tubes stuck membranes cells. insides channels
hydrophobic, allowing water molecules just jut really quickly almost
mind, can just imagine sort lubricated water, though not
really lubricated. water molecules can move single files, million per
second. Now. need two ways water get across cell membranes,
one fairly slow basic diffusion diffusion. Folks movement
things gradient higher concentration lower concentration, think
this, things tend run downhill higher concentration lower
concentration, try create equilibrium across space. know
bunch marbles one side box there, just imagine water
molecules charges hydrogens oxygens.
tendency marbles spread essentially take fairly even


conformation. That’s basically just diffusion across space. Water molecules will also
move higher concentration lower concentration across cell membranes,
portals tubes channels. called aquaporin
channels, water molecules can move quickly now reason biology
seems created aquaporin channels wasn't consulted
design phase. logical explanation many tissues within
body. often need water water quickly need release water quickly.
think couple look actual distribution
aquaporin channels throughout body. area body that,
occasion will need move water quickly it? can use imagination
here, will just tell that, instance, tear, glands tear ducts need
release tears quickly. need take water, That’s stored body.

00:55:14 Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants

Okay, talked water can get cells. two ways: diffusion

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not

might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea

awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,

certainly not saying that, fact people going find going

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number

sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours

separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief

water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage

back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether

sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours

separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,
quote: unquote hardness water. hardness water? know?
better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium
calcium. However, encourage take step back consider
literature. fact, will mention paper particular now published 2019,
describes quote: regulations calcium magnesium hardness drinking water
European Union. Member states turns Europe detailed Water
Analysis That’s present number really high quality scientific Publications.
paper published regulatory, toxicology pharmacology, cite
number different references introduction that, instance, here, quoting
statistically significant inverse association magnesium cardiovascular

water, lower cardiovascular mortality, go say highest exposure
category, people consuming drinking water magnesium contents 8.3
19.4 milligrams per liter. Again, get Water Analysis, can compare
again. values significantly associated decreased likelihood
cardiovascular mortality 25, compared people consuming magnesium content
2.5 8.2 milligrams per liter okay. basically shows, way,
reference will, also provide link to, show note caption basically

basically, study quotes, growing consensus among epidemiologists

minds, is: magnesium calcium concentrations relevant

calcium cells? magnesium calcium deficient? Well, turns out.
That’s not case. major effect magnesium calcium water
likely impact things like blood pressure, cardiovascular disease aspects
cellular function turn somewhat cryptic. can make cryptic aspect
clear saying magnesium particular, also calcium

again, not mean trying change pH cells body

little bit concerned maybe clip going taken sent elsewhere,
someone will get impression saying actually want drink high pH
water need Buy expensive, high, pH water turns out. That’s not case
consuming tap water location levels magnesium sufficiently
high tap water again, level magnesium 8.3 19.4 milligrams per

chances don't need enhance pH water change magnesium
concentration? If, however, water drinking tap filtered not,


hope, filtered contains less 8.3 milligrams per liter magnesium. Well, then,
chances pH water going low enough, not going

said higher pH water can good you.

01:53:40 Water Temperature

talk higher pH water can good
best fact, inexpensive sources higher, pH magnesium, enhanced simply
tap water contains sufficient magnesium can used accessed. Many
probably wondering whether not can simply boil tap water thereby
decontaminate tap water there. want caution you. turns

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move
gut body bit readily across aquaporin channels,
readily lower, pH, acidic water. Well, raises question whether
not different forms water there: reverse osmosis water,
distilled water, double distilled water, deuterium, depleted water, alkaline water,
often called whether not meaningful Health outcomes.
can address items pretty quickly, instance, distilled water double
distilled water essentially distilled is. magnesium calcium removed
it. recommendation not drink distilled water. may
specific circumstances somebody high levels blood, magnesium
calcium calcium stores within body necessitate drinking

somebody curious reverse osmosis water can afford filters
reverse osmosis water already pre-filtered, please guest, know drink it.
certainly not trying prevent anyone drinking it. no peer-reviewed

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,

00:19:27 Water: Physical Properties & Chemistry

talk water and, start off answering question: water water
is, course, H2O. everybody knows early age, H2O means
molecule water consists two hydrogens one oxygen. Now
physical arrangement two hydrogens one oxygen turns really
important water functions body and, frankly elsewhere world

what’s important that, visual impression visual image individual water

water molecules polarized can bind one another. way
polarization - something kind learned chemistry
one point - many us forgot - maybe didn't even understand - first time
around, positives negatives attract. individual water
molecules, opportunity interact essentially bind one another
bind called covalent bonds. Covalent bonds relatively weak

covalent bonds strong enough water actually can maintain structure
structure will vary, course depending temperature. need
know water that, indeed, consists lots individual h2os h2os can
arrange different ways temperature strong determinant

fact, even spacing bonds. again, even don't
chemistry stay me, definitely understand this, water can exist
least three forms maybe four forms. know can liquid. course, That’s
really. Normally, think think water, can gas, think
steam right. So, heat up, takes uh, not semi-solid semi-liquid form.
takes property steam gas. Okay. see Steam um

Water Works within body well, especially different temperatures


water impact, health behavior cells important point
understand water solid state that, unlike substances water
solid state, actually less dense liquid state. just think
substances like metals, instance, solid state.
dense liquid state, so, instance, solid

interesting because, you, cool water water transitions liquid solid
still binds, is, can form bonds different molecules water,

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink

20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

depends. depend on? Well, depends several things. First
all, highly recommend everybody go online put zip code ask
water analysis water comes tap zip code. something
readily available online, least knowledge, and, unfortunately, no
specific one site can send everyone get in-depth analysis drinking
water comes TAP. However, highly recommend go online
put ZIP code Municipal area code figure whether not water

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just

occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good

contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier

just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't

even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired

deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks

skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,

percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even

might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink

sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

water molecules polarized can bind one another. way
polarization - something kind learned chemistry
one point - many us forgot - maybe didn't even understand - first time
around, positives negatives attract. individual water

confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar

just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't

enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.

going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra

day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,

certainly not saying that, fact people going find going

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number

body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid

sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours

separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter

harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief

realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go

filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,

anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first

now, minimum, everyone understand water particular

water molecules can change conformation. is, can bind water

confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar

reasons related chemistry water. can explain that, but, transition
talking physics chemistry water water actually behaves

important understand molecules sugar salt can hydrophilic or,
know, oil water don't mix, That’s oils lipids so-called hydrophobic.
What’s hydrophobic, just think. Ah phobic certain molecules lipids, don't
dissolve well water, intuitively understand take olive oil,
instance - put little glass water, it'll likely float beat form

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series

hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,

brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune

somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water

Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-

filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable

will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing

things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call

realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

haven't talked happens water cells,
simple explain. water inside cells, going incorporated

free radicals, sounds pretty wild right, free radicals. free radicals? Free
radicals can damage cells, don't always damage cells, can damage cells
essentially free electrons. charge. That’s sitting
not bound anything therefore can interact molecular structure certain
proteins change structures binding interfering normal,
binding processes proteins water things, way, cause
damage proteins potentially damage cells now, fortunately, cells

Antioxidants molecules can arrive different forms. Sometimes think
antioxidants vitamins, also present things well, essentially
bind free radicals repair bonds cells, proteins no

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not

board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight

exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks

exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric
emptying time, whether not particular exercise whether not
running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,

Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

00:55:14 Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants

Okay, talked water can get cells. two ways: diffusion

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not

exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water

threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container

Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-

filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable

harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing

things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call

realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present

Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take

much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new

lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

now, minimum, everyone understand water particular
structure. hear H2O, can kind imagine structure
water molecules can change conformation. is, can bind water
molecules turns can bind things actually change
confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar
molecules, turning solid liquid, essentially creating called
solutes, basically um dissolving solids liquid solutions. fact,
water one best solvents planet. fact, water better dissolving many
solids acid right. That’s incredible water is, number
reasons related chemistry water. can explain that, but, transition
talking physics chemistry water water actually behaves
within body contributes health disease depending case,
important understand molecules sugar salt can hydrophilic or,
know, oil water don't mix, That’s oils lipids so-called hydrophobic.
What’s hydrophobic, just think. Ah phobic certain molecules lipids, don't
dissolve well water, intuitively understand take olive oil,
instance - put little glass water, it'll likely float beat form
little spherical amoeba-like Shapes within water That’s oil lipids
hydrophobic different substances either going hydrophilic,

Require water order get proper amount water cells,
basically two ways water can access cells. zoom second
ask ourselves, water actually get body? us just think? Oh,
drink water body. course, That’s main way. can also breathe

may be, basically two ways water can access cells. first way
known long time, so-called diffusion. Now,
outside cells made fatty, stuff lipid. So, instance, neurons nerve cells
lipid bilayer, two layers fat, already know fat lipid
hydrophobic. Okay. Now turns not problem, solution water


can get across lipid barrier. Why? fact water can change

way water accesses cells - Way water accesses cells really
something just discovered 10 years ago. fairly recent
discovery turns fundamental discovery, presence
called aquaporin channels. Aquaporin channels basically portals

rate 1 million h2os 1 million water molecules per second way water
molecules move across cell membrane aquaporin channels
interesting, inside channels way think literally
tubes stuck membranes cells. insides channels
hydrophobic, allowing water molecules just jut really quickly almost
mind, can just imagine sort lubricated water, though not
really lubricated. water molecules can move single files, million per
second. Now. need two ways water get across cell membranes,
one fairly slow basic diffusion diffusion. Folks movement
things gradient higher concentration lower concentration, think
this, things tend run downhill higher concentration lower
concentration, try create equilibrium across space. know
bunch marbles one side box there, just imagine water
molecules charges hydrogens oxygens.
tendency marbles spread essentially take fairly even


conformation. That’s basically just diffusion across space. Water molecules will also
move higher concentration lower concentration across cell membranes,
portals tubes channels. called aquaporin
channels, water molecules can move quickly now reason biology
seems created aquaporin channels wasn't consulted
design phase. logical explanation many tissues within
body. often need water water quickly need release water quickly.
think couple look actual distribution
aquaporin channels throughout body. area body that,
occasion will need move water quickly it? can use imagination
here, will just tell that, instance, tear, glands tear ducts need

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not
heated. Well, trying arrive numbers can work across
board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight
activity environment humidity formula calculation. fact, no calculation
exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks
levels water intake periods rest not exercising
exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric
emptying time, whether not particular exercise whether not
running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,



01:15:40 Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine

common question is, exercising heated environment, indoor outdoor
somebody tends sweat lot way can get better
sweating sweating. sweat adaptation. sit sauna,
going get better sweating, exercise more, especially wear
layers hotter temperatures humid temperatures, going
get better sweating time sweating adaptation helps cool body
body sweating lot heat. much fluid ingest
general? think safe say may want increase values Galpin
equation 50 100. either increase 50 double numbers,
hot environment sweating awful lot. sitting sauna, highly
recommend consuming least eight ounces probably like 16 ounces fluid.
translates 240 480, just round 500 milliliters
fluid every 20 30 minutes hot sauna course, people
ask well hot okay starts getting really detailed, can't distinguish
dry saunas wet saunas many variables, double
fluid intake hot environment exercise hot environment sauna sit.
Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,
thirsty. Well, then, absolutely no problem ingesting
fluids: 16 ounces fluid 500 milliliters fluid per hour, feeling parched.
read literature thirst reasonable guide tend
dehydrated. However, case thirst doesn't really keep body's
level dehydration, know that, based really nice studies
explored amount fluid intake compared amount urination compared
amount physical output Compared environment one happens
sort older studies realm physiology, basic rule thumb,
That’s going work people. feeling parched consume fluids. Ideally,
consume fluids don't contain caffeine diuretics diuretics um
substances cause release, urination fluid body
consuming caffeine, prior bouts exercise even just work

01:19:15 Hydration; Cognitive & Physical Performance

Now, hopefully, will provide good rules thumb people want
they're, just moving day underscored fact even slight levels

01:23:53 Tool: Water Filtration; Nighttime Urination

Now earlier talking equations can apply,
really want emphasize equations not meant followed

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new

lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds

looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

now, minimum, everyone understand water particular

water molecules can change conformation. is, can bind water
molecules turns can bind things actually change
confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar
molecules, turning solid liquid, essentially creating called

water one best solvents planet. fact, water better dissolving many

reasons related chemistry water. can explain that, but, transition
talking physics chemistry water water actually behaves
within body contributes health disease depending case,
important understand molecules sugar salt can hydrophilic or,
know, oil water don't mix, That’s oils lipids so-called hydrophobic.
What’s hydrophobic, just think. Ah phobic certain molecules lipids, don't
dissolve well water, intuitively understand take olive oil,
instance - put little glass water, it'll likely float beat form

00:41:49 Water Transport Cells, Aquaporin Channels

Okay, cells body, every cell, even bones, osteoblasts
cells within bones, bone marrow, red blood cells, white

something just discovered 10 years ago. fairly recent
discovery turns fundamental discovery, presence
called aquaporin channels. Aquaporin channels basically portals

hydrophobic, allowing water molecules just jut really quickly almost
mind, can just imagine sort lubricated water, though not
really lubricated. water molecules can move single files, million per

one fairly slow basic diffusion diffusion. Folks movement
things gradient higher concentration lower concentration, think
this, things tend run downhill higher concentration lower
concentration, try create equilibrium across space. know
bunch marbles one side box there, just imagine water

move higher concentration lower concentration across cell membranes,
portals tubes channels. called aquaporin
channels, water molecules can move quickly now reason biology
seems created aquaporin channels wasn't consulted

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not
heated. Well, trying arrive numbers can work across
board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight
activity environment humidity formula calculation. fact, no calculation
exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks
levels water intake periods rest not exercising
exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended

can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,
turns can create hydrogen enriched Water putting tablets magnesium
itself? Small amounts magnesium dissolving water. will give off kind


gaseous solution. see bunch bubbling there. certainly want dilute
tablet consume water. yes, true heard
read commercial sources. want consume water within
know 5 15 minutes tablet completes dissolving now.
this, say now started this, not necessarily think
necessary beneficial will talk experience moment.
anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first
part entitled electrolyzed reduced water. Molecular hydrogen exclusive agent
responsible therapeutic effects second part review.
extensive entitled: electrolyze, reduced water number, two safety concerns
Effectiveness source hydrogen water. review uh, linked
show notes points to, health benefits different forms
water hear there, deuterium depleted hydrogen, enrich, Etc seem
boil down, no pun intended no boiling included. say elevation
hydrogen translates really meaningful change elevation PH
occurs you, hydrogen enrich water. Now not lot clinical studies
looking hydrogen Rich water, starting one
like point link published fairly recently,
entitled. Hydrogen-Rich water reduces inflammatory responses prevents apoptosis.
Apoptosis naturally occurring cell death development generally used
describe cell death body. Sometimes can good cell death way,
removing cells need removed again. title paper hydrogen-rich:
water, reduces inflammatory responses prevents apoptosis peripheral blood cells
healthy adults, randomized double-blind control trial. Now paper looked

weeks. find significant positive benefits reduced inflammation found
changes way analyzing things like interleukin 6
interleukins, markers inflammation. control nicely fact
people still consuming forms water liquid coffee Etc, although
made sure weren't consuming much coffee soda. addition
hydrogen enriched water. paper shows indeed increasing free
hydrogen water can improve certain Health metrics cells,


keeping subjective reports people stated
experienced. say drinking hydrogen Rich water, will tell
fairly inexpensively moment, get subjective experience
energy feeling better quote, unquote. Now keep mind, course
placebo effect real Powerful effect, just Placebo, although
paper course include placebo group, people didn't know
getting hydrogen Rich water non-hydrogen-rich water. also mention
improvements health metrics observed study
observed individuals older 30 years old. is, don't know
conclusions authors came terms individuals, older 30,
achieved lower levels, or, say, reduced levels inflammation improved
markers aspects biological function? hydrogen water improved
biological antioxidant potential certain cell types again, cell types
mainly focus on? peripheral blood cells particular study? Now,
be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium
filter drink think just fine. If, however, levels magnesium
tap water not value talked earlier. case,
think - can completely understand enriching amount hydrogen
water can make water not palatable right, give Sensation

Perhaps every biological function within brain body

02:11:13 Tool: Molecular Hydrogen Tablets, Water pH

can hydrogen enrich water actually can done fairly

02:14:05 Structured Water

Now earlier episode discussing structured water fourth phase
water. know number people out. curious whether not ingesting
structured water somehow better us ingesting non-structured water. can
say this. controversial thing suggest structured water
somehow biologically effective better us non-structured water.
number different ways one can create structured water. involve
pretty extensive expensive at-home systems, ranging anywhere couple
hundred dollars couple thousand dollars quite direct one goes
peer-reviewed scientific literature, one will not find is. essentially no
real evidence ingesting structured water leads specific desired biological


outcomes, say sure people still
tremendous experiences ingesting structured water, whether not That’s due
placebo effect real Effect ingesting structured water isn't clear just give
sense stance things like structured water. think
interesting intriguing, scientist absence quality peer-reviewed
data present, can't really suggest people go start ingesting structured
water, adhere claims structured water going Really really
good compared forms water. said, think
interesting open space exploration biological effects structured

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail
physics chemistry water various forms, talked hydration
think That’s main reason many interested concerned
water. also talked contaminants tap water, which, unfortunately,
exist prominent essentially regions world. please get
information about. What’s coming TAP, also want throw one
piece information. That’s really critical learned researching
episode, quality water comes TAP, not just dictated
source comes external home apartment. pipes also
important filter, little mesh sits faucet head also


important. people don't pay attention that, turns lot debris
contaminants can derived little filter people just simply aren't
cleaning. Often enough. not trying tell metal plastic
filter made problem. often not, contaminants showing
water people aren't cleaning filters, often enough fact prior
researching episode. didn't ever think clean filter. looked underneath
faucet filter didn't look particularly filled debris, find
took off - looked side - quite lot debris.
going consume tap water, definitely want consider source, pipes
building, apartment, ones lead right glass jug,
put water also mesh water passes goes
glass jug, also talked much water drink. hope finally resolve
question wondering that. Galpin equation
wonderful approach much water consume. exercise

much better understanding chemistry Physics water
way water can powerfully impact biology,


water.

00:37:37 Water Solvent, Temperature & phone. will respond soon.

now, minimum, everyone understand water particular
structure. hear H2O, can kind imagine structure
water molecules can change conformation. is, can bind water
molecules turns can bind things actually change
confirmation things. good example something familiar with,
water's ability dissolve certain substances like sugar salt,
salt molecules sugar molecules call hydrophilic. like water
say like water. just means chemical structure salt,
sodium chemical structure say sucrose like table. Sugar can actually interact
hydrogens oxygens water can change salt molecules sugar
molecules, turning solid liquid, essentially creating called
solutes, basically um dissolving solids liquid solutions. fact,
water one best solvents planet. fact, water better dissolving many
solids acid right. That’s incredible water is, number
reasons related chemistry water. can explain that, but, transition
talking physics chemistry water water actually behaves
within body contributes health disease depending case,
important understand molecules sugar salt can hydrophilic or,
know, oil water don't mix, That’s oils lipids so-called hydrophobic.
What’s hydrophobic, just think. Ah phobic certain molecules lipids, don't
dissolve well water, intuitively understand take olive oil,
instance - put little glass water, it'll likely float beat form
little spherical amoeba-like Shapes within water That’s oil lipids
hydrophobic different substances either going hydrophilic,
is, going greater propensity interact water bind
different aspects water molecules hydrophobic less propensity
interact bind water molecules sort alluding
numerous times throughout podcast already, temperature water pH
alkalinity acidity water will strong impact Whether not
hydrophilic hydrophobic substance will greater lesser tendency interact


water. know intuitively well. ever tried dissolve, say big
tablespoon sugar cold water, notice grains don't dissolve
quickly take big tablespoon sugar put warm hot cup
water. That’s temperature water actually changes well
Sugar molecule able change conformation interact water molecules.
Likewise, want get something, That’s really hydrophilic aqueous
water containing solution. temperature also going strongly impact now
near infinite number examples temperature pH impact

going go details. migrate discussion
physics chemistry water water behaves within body,
going now then, continue third part discussion,
certain types Water familiar with, like
different pH water, distilled water, reverse osmosis water, different types
water thought cases, fact change ways cells

00:41:49 Water Transport Cells, Aquaporin Channels

Okay, cells body, every cell, even bones, osteoblasts
cells within bones, bone marrow, red blood cells, white
blood cells, neurons, nerve cells, liver cells, kidney cells, them,
Require water order get proper amount water cells,
basically two ways water can access cells. zoom second
ask ourselves, water actually get body? us just think? Oh,
drink water body. course, That’s main way. can also breathe
water molecules body humid air hydrate cells, is,
bringing water cells, water needs move gut
bloodstream eventually individual cells, whatever cell type.
may be, basically two ways water can access cells. first way
known long time, so-called diffusion. Now,
outside cells made fatty, stuff lipid. So, instance, neurons nerve cells
lipid bilayer, two layers fat, already know fat lipid
hydrophobic. Okay. Now turns not problem, solution water


can get across lipid barrier. Why? fact water can change
conformation lipids can change conformation just enough bonds
water bonds hydrophobic lipids can interact. Allowing
water molecule basically pass lipid, can Bond weakly
cases, not weakly lipids pushed
side. Really incredible, think it, much
hydrophobic relationship lipid water, water come
surface fatty outside cells repelled away
Just stay right surface, no good
actually need water diffuse across cell membranes, actually
double cell membrane, mentioned before, two layers, water lipids cells can
interact just enough Affinity water molecule can diffuse across cell
membrane barriers, important, diffusion water molecules across
lipid barriers outsides cells fairly slow process compared
way water accesses cells - Way water accesses cells really
something just discovered 10 years ago. fairly recent
discovery turns fundamental discovery, presence
called aquaporin channels. Aquaporin channels basically portals
membrane allow water molecules move quickly across cell membranes,
rate 1 million h2os 1 million water molecules per second way water
molecules move across cell membrane aquaporin channels
interesting, inside channels way think literally
tubes stuck membranes cells. insides channels
hydrophobic, allowing water molecules just jut really quickly almost
mind, can just imagine sort lubricated water, though not
really lubricated. water molecules can move single files, million per
second. Now. need two ways water get across cell membranes,
one fairly slow basic diffusion diffusion. Folks movement
things gradient higher concentration lower concentration, think
this, things tend run downhill higher concentration lower
concentration, try create equilibrium across space. know
bunch marbles one side box there, just imagine water
molecules charges hydrogens oxygens.
tendency marbles spread essentially take fairly even


conformation. That’s basically just diffusion across space. Water molecules will also
move higher concentration lower concentration across cell membranes,
portals tubes channels. called aquaporin
channels, water molecules can move quickly now reason biology
seems created aquaporin channels wasn't consulted
design phase. logical explanation many tissues within
body. often need water water quickly need release water quickly.
think couple look actual distribution
aquaporin channels throughout body. area body that,
occasion will need move water quickly it? can use imagination
here, will just tell that, instance, tear, glands tear ducts need
release tears quickly. need take water, That’s stored body.
emotional experience look bright light, instance, um
uh, know, God forbid. get sort irritant eye, going start
tear tears release fluid tear ducts. going
Rapid Release water tear ducts so-called aquaporin
channels fact, aquaporin channels heavily expressed. many
cells so-called lacrimal glands release tears. addition, need
absorb water gut, gut lining, endothelial lining cell
Linings. Mucosal lining water needs often move quickly stomach
rest body, one way accomplished aquaporin
channels expressed along gut. discovery aquaporin
channels really highly significant. terms understanding different ways
water can interact get cells body now aquaporin
channels, not just lacrimal glands allow tearing within gut,
many tissues within body, even different distributions within
tissues, fact, one looks expression different aquaporin channels,
turns they're, different forms across cells tissues
body. really no single tissue within body, except perhaps bones
body perhaps ligaments extent don't aquaporin
channels. out, may heard so-called fascia fascia
sheath muscles unique kind connective tissue gives pliability yet

incredible tissue entire episode fascia point: fascinating,


fascinating tissue fascia even contain aquaporin channels, role aquaporin

00:55:14 Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants

Okay, talked water can get cells. two ways: diffusion
movement. aquaporin channels, earmarked discussion
temperature pH water - is, confirmation water,
really want embed people's minds, talk temperature
water pH water, really talking arrangement h2os,
water molecules, keep mind, covered water can get cells
two different ways: diffusion aquaporin channels.
haven't talked happens water cells,

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not
heated. Well, trying arrive numbers can work across
board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight
activity environment humidity formula calculation. fact, no calculation
exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks
levels water intake periods rest not exercising
exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric
emptying time, whether not particular exercise whether not
running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,



01:15:40 Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine

common question is, exercising heated environment, indoor outdoor
somebody tends sweat lot way can get better
sweating sweating. sweat adaptation. sit sauna,
going get better sweating, exercise more, especially wear
layers hotter temperatures humid temperatures, going
get better sweating time sweating adaptation helps cool body
body sweating lot heat. much fluid ingest
general? think safe say may want increase values Galpin
equation 50 100. either increase 50 double numbers,
hot environment sweating awful lot. sitting sauna, highly
recommend consuming least eight ounces probably like 16 ounces fluid.
translates 240 480, just round 500 milliliters
fluid every 20 30 minutes hot sauna course, people
ask well hot okay starts getting really detailed, can't distinguish
dry saunas wet saunas many variables, double
fluid intake hot environment exercise hot environment sauna sit.
Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,
thirsty. Well, then, absolutely no problem ingesting
fluids: 16 ounces fluid 500 milliliters fluid per hour, feeling parched.
read literature thirst reasonable guide tend
dehydrated. However, case thirst doesn't really keep body's

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

02:14:05 Structured Water

Now earlier episode discussing structured water fourth phase
water. know number people out. curious whether not ingesting
structured water somehow better us ingesting non-structured water. can
say this. controversial thing suggest structured water
somehow biologically effective better us non-structured water.
number different ways one can create structured water. involve
pretty extensive expensive at-home systems, ranging anywhere couple
hundred dollars couple thousand dollars quite direct one goes
peer-reviewed scientific literature, one will not find is. essentially no
real evidence ingesting structured water leads specific desired biological


outcomes, say sure people still
tremendous experiences ingesting structured water, whether not That’s due
placebo effect real Effect ingesting structured water isn't clear just give
sense stance things like structured water. think
interesting intriguing, scientist absence quality peer-reviewed
data present, can't really suggest people go start ingesting structured
water, adhere claims structured water going Really really
good compared forms water. said, think
interesting open space exploration biological effects structured
water, given fact structured water exist, don't think anyone debates
fact different structures water fourth phase water
calling, shown interface solids aspects liquids can
within organelles cells, different components cells control different
functions, including mitochondria. think potential there, whether not

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail
physics chemistry water various forms, talked hydration
think That’s main reason many interested concerned
water. also talked contaminants tap water, which, unfortunately,
exist prominent essentially regions world. please get
information about. What’s coming TAP, also want throw one
piece information. That’s really critical learned researching
episode, quality water comes TAP, not just dictated
source comes external home apartment. pipes also
important filter, little mesh sits faucet head also


important. people don't pay attention that, turns lot debris
contaminants can derived little filter people just simply aren't
cleaning. Often enough. not trying tell metal plastic
filter made problem. often not, contaminants showing
water people aren't cleaning filters, often enough fact prior
researching episode. didn't ever think clean filter. looked underneath
faucet filter didn't look particularly filled debris, find
took off - looked side - quite lot debris.
going consume tap water, definitely want consider source, pipes
building, apartment, ones lead right glass jug,

much better understanding chemistry Physics water
way water can powerfully impact biology,


water. know intuitively well. ever tried dissolve, say big
tablespoon sugar cold water, notice grains don't dissolve
quickly take big tablespoon sugar put warm hot cup
water. That’s temperature water actually changes well

00:41:49 Water Transport Cells, Aquaporin Channels

Okay, cells body, every cell, even bones, osteoblasts
cells within bones, bone marrow, red blood cells, white
blood cells, neurons, nerve cells, liver cells, kidney cells, them,
Require water order get proper amount water cells,
basically two ways water can access cells. zoom second
ask ourselves, water actually get body? us just think? Oh,
drink water body. course, That’s main way. can also breathe
water molecules body humid air hydrate cells, is,
bringing water cells, water needs move gut
bloodstream eventually individual cells, whatever cell type.
may be, basically two ways water can access cells. first way
known long time, so-called diffusion. Now,
outside cells made fatty, stuff lipid. So, instance, neurons nerve cells
lipid bilayer, two layers fat, already know fat lipid
hydrophobic. Okay. Now turns not problem, solution water


can get across lipid barrier. Why? fact water can change
conformation lipids can change conformation just enough bonds
water bonds hydrophobic lipids can interact. Allowing
water molecule basically pass lipid, can Bond weakly
cases, not weakly lipids pushed
side. Really incredible, think it, much
hydrophobic relationship lipid water, water come
surface fatty outside cells repelled away
Just stay right surface, no good
actually need water diffuse across cell membranes, actually
double cell membrane, mentioned before, two layers, water lipids cells can
interact just enough Affinity water molecule can diffuse across cell
membrane barriers, important, diffusion water molecules across
lipid barriers outsides cells fairly slow process compared
way water accesses cells - Way water accesses cells really
something just discovered 10 years ago. fairly recent
discovery turns fundamental discovery, presence
called aquaporin channels. Aquaporin channels basically portals
membrane allow water molecules move quickly across cell membranes,
rate 1 million h2os 1 million water molecules per second way water
molecules move across cell membrane aquaporin channels
interesting, inside channels way think literally
tubes stuck membranes cells. insides channels
hydrophobic, allowing water molecules just jut really quickly almost
mind, can just imagine sort lubricated water, though not
really lubricated. water molecules can move single files, million per
second. Now. need two ways water get across cell membranes,
one fairly slow basic diffusion diffusion. Folks movement
things gradient higher concentration lower concentration, think
this, things tend run downhill higher concentration lower
concentration, try create equilibrium across space. know
bunch marbles one side box there, just imagine water
molecules charges hydrogens oxygens.
tendency marbles spread essentially take fairly even


conformation. That’s basically just diffusion across space. Water molecules will also
move higher concentration lower concentration across cell membranes,
portals tubes channels. called aquaporin
channels, water molecules can move quickly now reason biology
seems created aquaporin channels wasn't consulted
design phase. logical explanation many tissues within
body. often need water water quickly need release water quickly.
think couple look actual distribution
aquaporin channels throughout body. area body that,
occasion will need move water quickly it? can use imagination
here, will just tell that, instance, tear, glands tear ducts need
release tears quickly. need take water, That’s stored body.
emotional experience look bright light, instance, um
uh, know, God forbid. get sort irritant eye, going start
tear tears release fluid tear ducts. going
Rapid Release water tear ducts so-called aquaporin

cells so-called lacrimal glands release tears. addition, need
absorb water gut, gut lining, endothelial lining cell
Linings. Mucosal lining water needs often move quickly stomach
rest body, one way accomplished aquaporin
channels expressed along gut. discovery aquaporin
channels really highly significant. terms understanding different ways
water can interact get cells body now aquaporin
channels, not just lacrimal glands allow tearing within gut,
many tissues within body, even different distributions within
tissues, fact, one looks expression different aquaporin channels,
turns they're, different forms across cells tissues
body. really no single tissue within body, except perhaps bones
body perhaps ligaments extent don't aquaporin
channels. out, may heard so-called fascia fascia

00:55:14 Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants

Okay, talked water can get cells. two ways: diffusion

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not
heated. Well, trying arrive numbers can work across
board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight
activity environment humidity formula calculation. fact, no calculation
exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks
levels water intake periods rest not exercising
exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric
emptying time, whether not particular exercise whether not
running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,



01:15:40 Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine

common question is, exercising heated environment, indoor outdoor
somebody tends sweat lot way can get better
sweating sweating. sweat adaptation. sit sauna,
going get better sweating, exercise more, especially wear
layers hotter temperatures humid temperatures, going
get better sweating time sweating adaptation helps cool body
body sweating lot heat. much fluid ingest
general? think safe say may want increase values Galpin
equation 50 100. either increase 50 double numbers,
hot environment sweating awful lot. sitting sauna, highly
recommend consuming least eight ounces probably like 16 ounces fluid.
translates 240 480, just round 500 milliliters

ask well hot okay starts getting really detailed, can't distinguish
dry saunas wet saunas many variables, double
fluid intake hot environment exercise hot environment sauna sit.
Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,
thirsty. Well, then, absolutely no problem ingesting
fluids: 16 ounces fluid 500 milliliters fluid per hour, feeling parched.
read literature thirst reasonable guide tend
dehydrated. However, case thirst doesn't really keep body's
level dehydration, know that, based really nice studies
explored amount fluid intake compared amount urination compared

sort older studies realm physiology, basic rule thumb,
That’s going work people. feeling parched consume fluids. Ideally,
consume fluids don't contain caffeine diuretics diuretics um

01:19:15 Hydration; Cognitive & Physical Performance

Now, hopefully, will provide good rules thumb people want
they're, just moving day underscored fact even slight levels

01:23:53 Tool: Water Filtration; Nighttime Urination

Now earlier talking equations can apply,
really want emphasize equations not meant followed
decimal point. really meant arment crude, sufficient guides
make sure getting enough hydration depending levels

filtering fluid 10 fact can say want reduce nighttime
waking order urinate, common common question concern many
people can avoid waking middle night urinate
say Perfectly Normal - wake maybe twice night urinate.
want reduce number times wake order urinate across night,
maybe even make number zero times. will greatly benefit three things.
First make sure hydrating sufficiently daytime per

feels right feel comfortable gulping fluid. However, evening,
somebody challenges waking excessively middle
night, reduce fluid intake provided hydrated properly throughout day,
suggest consuming no five. Maybe eight ounces fluid time
10 hours waking go sleep again, thirsty


hydrated hot, feel free ingest fluid. Please. people will find
reduce fluid intake five ounces less fluid later part

thorough, great, entitled endocrine disruptors water effects
reproductive system. review 2020 analyzes water bunch
different sources within world essentially focuses key components.
First all, focuses concentration minerals magnesium calcium
within water. Many people don't realize this, so-called hard water sounds terrible
right, hard water water contains magnesium calcium, turns
good thing. water contains magnesium calcium water
contains less. looked presence magnesium calcium


going impact pH water general, higher concentrations magnesium
calcium water, higher pH is, alkaline water lower

thing review addresses concentration so-called dbps dog Bulldog,
porcupines dbps, disinfection byproducts contained water, obviously
local governments. government wants drinking water clean. don't
want contaminants don't want sewage water. don't want chemical
contaminants going make people immediately sick, treat water, water
treatment plants treat water disinfection products disinfection products
create things called disinfection byproducts presence dbps just
disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact pH water, way changing
concentrations magnesium calcium put differently, believe governments
trying provide people clean water, so, oftentimes introduce
things water not good us. Now. clear dbps can cause
endocrine disruption ways not good Reproductive health. long,
fact, four half hour episode fertility vitality male female

dbps shown disrupt ovarian function, spermatogenesis fertility
outcomes, even concentrations dbps present drinking water. comes
tap now. mean shouldn't drink tap water? Well, answer
depends. depend on? Well, depends several things. First
all, highly recommend everybody go online put zip code ask
water analysis water comes tap zip code. something
readily available online, least knowledge, and, unfortunately, no
specific one site can send everyone get in-depth analysis drinking
water comes TAP. However, highly recommend go online
put ZIP code Municipal area code figure whether not water
contains x amount dbps Y amount dbps. Now, course, going get
bunch values back unless toxicologist, probably not going know
values mean, really looking whether not high low
moderate levels fluoride drinking water. say that? Well,
studies show concentration fluoride drinking water particular


concern thyroid hormone system body now thyroid hormone lot
different roles brain body, thyroid hormone important everything
metabolism levels energy, thyroid levels disrupted thyroid,
receptors disrupted, can lead depression thyroid hormones optimized,
can lead Optimal mood thing, words helps keep
mood elevated. relates everything sleep reproduction thyroid hormones
involved many many things, including bone health tissue Health generally.
essentially, every biological process body impacted thyroid hormone
study like highlight, published 2018, title
study impact drinking water, fluoride, human thyroid hormones. case
control study, not extensive analysis many individuals. However,
shows fluoride, negative impacts thyroid stimulating hormone so-called T3
levels, thyroid hormone T3 T4, even standard concentrations
present important number 0.5 milligrams per liter okay.
can get hold fluoride concentrations tap water find whether not
concentrations exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter, will find
even just 0.5 milligrams per liter water can disrupt thyroid Function -
going particular concern people familial genetically related thyroid
issues concerned keeping thyroid hormone levels healthy,
think everybody. telling try get hold data
water comes tap. intend drinking tap water -
probably even don't just know what’s drinking water, local government
provide information readily available online
particular, think worthwhile address much fluoride present. drinking
water again, don't want create lot scare, not trying trigger fear here.
think, however, way reading review way reading paper just
referred moment ago. Again, links going provided show,
note captions, extensive evidence elevated levels fluoride drinking
water simply not good us now. open whole discussion Florida
drinking water. first place, all,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,
quote: unquote hardness water. hardness water? know?
better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium
calcium. However, encourage take step back consider

best fact, inexpensive sources higher, pH magnesium, enhanced simply
tap water contains sufficient magnesium can used accessed. Many
probably wondering whether not can simply boil tap water thereby

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move
gut body bit readily across aquaporin channels,
readily lower, pH, acidic water. Well, raises question whether
not different forms water there: reverse osmosis water,
distilled water, double distilled water, deuterium, depleted water, alkaline water,
often called whether not meaningful Health outcomes.
can address items pretty quickly, instance, distilled water double
distilled water essentially distilled is. magnesium calcium removed

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,

back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number

sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours

eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s

brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune

going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake

10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume

can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,
turns can create hydrogen enriched Water putting tablets magnesium
itself? Small amounts magnesium dissolving water. will give off kind


gaseous solution. see bunch bubbling there. certainly want dilute

read commercial sources. want consume water within
know 5 15 minutes tablet completes dissolving now.
this, say now started this, not necessarily think
necessary beneficial will talk experience moment.
anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first
part entitled electrolyzed reduced water. Molecular hydrogen exclusive agent

extensive entitled: electrolyze, reduced water number, two safety concerns
Effectiveness source hydrogen water. review uh, linked
show notes points to, health benefits different forms
water hear there, deuterium depleted hydrogen, enrich, Etc seem
boil down, no pun intended no boiling included. say elevation
hydrogen translates really meaningful change elevation PH
occurs you, hydrogen enrich water. Now not lot clinical studies
looking hydrogen Rich water, starting one
like point link published fairly recently,
entitled. Hydrogen-Rich water reduces inflammatory responses prevents apoptosis.
Apoptosis naturally occurring cell death development generally used
describe cell death body. Sometimes can good cell death way,
removing cells need removed again. title paper hydrogen-rich:

placebo effect real Powerful effect, just Placebo, although
paper course include placebo group, people didn't know
getting hydrogen Rich water non-hydrogen-rich water. also mention
improvements health metrics observed study
observed individuals older 30 years old. is, don't know
conclusions authors came terms individuals, older 30,
achieved lower levels, or, say, reduced levels inflammation improved

biological antioxidant potential certain cell types again, cell types
mainly focus on? peripheral blood cells particular study? Now,
be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not
heated. Well, trying arrive numbers can work across
board course, infinite number different conditions
existing in. not going attempt give body weight
activity environment humidity formula calculation. fact, no calculation
exists. However, formulas can put stable Frameworks

exercising. will ensure hydrating, one exception
exercising living very, hot conditions you're, not heat
adapted conditions. numbers? words,
answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric
emptying time, whether not particular exercise whether not
running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,



01:15:40 Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine

common question is, exercising heated environment, indoor outdoor

Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,
thirsty. Well, then, absolutely no problem ingesting
fluids: 16 ounces fluid 500 milliliters fluid per hour, feeling parched.
read literature thirst reasonable guide tend

deep breath, researching tap water what’s contained tap water
different regions, not just U.S around world. confess picture pretty
scary one. want clear, not somebody naturally orients towards fear
conspiracy theories, however, researching tap water episode. way
looking peer-reviewed research, meta-analysis reviews, specific research articles
specific hypotheses tested talking experts toxicology
on, pretty Grim picture. Frankly, one looks what’s contained tap
water whether not compounds contained tap water present
sufficient concentrations negatively impact health bad news. much
not tap water believe not? Much not tap water contains things bad
biology cells. silver lining, however, Silver Lining
simple steps inexpensive can used adjust tap water make
not just safe drink, makes perfectly fine drink. That’s good news
get moment. somebody interested whether
not tap water contains things like endocrine disruptors, hormone disruptors can
negatively impact reproductive Health males females Wonderful
review. Wonderful thorough, although news isn't great,
thorough, great, entitled endocrine disruptors water effects
reproductive system. review 2020 analyzes water bunch
different sources within world essentially focuses key components.
First all, focuses concentration minerals magnesium calcium
within water. Many people don't realize this, so-called hard water sounds terrible
right, hard water water contains magnesium calcium, turns
good thing. water contains magnesium calcium water
contains less. looked presence magnesium calcium


going impact pH water general, higher concentrations magnesium

local governments. government wants drinking water clean. don't
want contaminants don't want sewage water. don't want chemical
contaminants going make people immediately sick, treat water, water
treatment plants treat water disinfection products disinfection products
create things called disinfection byproducts presence dbps just
disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact pH water, way changing
concentrations magnesium calcium put differently, believe governments
trying provide people clean water, so, oftentimes introduce

outcomes, even concentrations dbps present drinking water. comes
tap now. mean shouldn't drink tap water? Well, answer
depends. depend on? Well, depends several things. First
all, highly recommend everybody go online put zip code ask
water analysis water comes tap zip code. something
readily available online, least knowledge, and, unfortunately, no
specific one site can send everyone get in-depth analysis drinking
water comes TAP. However, highly recommend go online
put ZIP code Municipal area code figure whether not water
contains x amount dbps Y amount dbps. Now, course, going get
bunch values back unless toxicologist, probably not going know
values mean, really looking whether not high low
moderate levels fluoride drinking water. say that? Well,
studies show concentration fluoride drinking water particular


concern thyroid hormone system body now thyroid hormone lot
different roles brain body, thyroid hormone important everything
metabolism levels energy, thyroid levels disrupted thyroid,
receptors disrupted, can lead depression thyroid hormones optimized,
can lead Optimal mood thing, words helps keep
mood elevated. relates everything sleep reproduction thyroid hormones
involved many many things, including bone health tissue Health generally.
essentially, every biological process body impacted thyroid hormone
study like highlight, published 2018, title
study impact drinking water, fluoride, human thyroid hormones. case
control study, not extensive analysis many individuals. However,
shows fluoride, negative impacts thyroid stimulating hormone so-called T3
levels, thyroid hormone T3 T4, even standard concentrations
present important number 0.5 milligrams per liter okay.
can get hold fluoride concentrations tap water find whether not
concentrations exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter, will find
even just 0.5 milligrams per liter water can disrupt thyroid Function -
going particular concern people familial genetically related thyroid
issues concerned keeping thyroid hormone levels healthy,
think everybody. telling try get hold data
water comes tap. intend drinking tap water -
probably even don't just know what’s drinking water, local government
provide information readily available online
particular, think worthwhile address much fluoride present. drinking
water again, don't want create lot scare, not trying trigger fear here.
think, however, way reading review way reading paper just
referred moment ago. Again, links going provided show,
note captions, extensive evidence elevated levels fluoride drinking
water simply not good us now. open whole discussion Florida
drinking water. first place, all,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body


weight. Now say independent body weight. referring amount fluid
healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments
very, hot here, mainly referring people live daily life
indoor environments air conditioned not. Air conditioned heated not

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take
hour exercise half hour exercise three hours exercise ask
much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

00:55:14 Water Cellular Function, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) & Antioxidants

Okay, talked water can get cells. two ways: diffusion

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra
marathoners people kind movement living environments

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take

much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,
bout exercise,



01:15:40 Tool: Hydration, Sauna, Humidity & Sweat; Thirst, Caffeine

Also, feeling dehydrated okay, feeling dehydrated mean
actually definition can get little bit later? really talking
is, feeling throat dry, quote unquote parched,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just

occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good

contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

healthy adults need rest. mean rest? mean not exercising
not extremely hot environments. leaving aside desert, Ultra

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity
environmental conditions, whether not fact ingesting 80 ounces basically
2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,
vastly different time wake 10 hours later
compared later evening night time. referring people
not night shifts, requesting number much fluid drink
independent needs fluid exercise, That’s going eight ounces fluid
240 milliliters fluid average. every hour, time wake
10 hours later, That’s simple formulation basically ensure
getting sufficient Baseline hydration cells tissues body.

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,
professor kinesiology, Cal State Fullerton. six episode series
exercise, everything strength, training, hypertrophy, endurance, nutrition,
supplementation recovery, everything related exercise. can find
hubermanlab.com one components episodes discussed,
may not heard simple formula much fluid
ingest average. Keep mind. average, exercising -
refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.
not case need stop every 15 20 minutes consume volume


fluid. sip moment moment wait half hour hour
consume larger bolus fluid larger amount. Although recommended
performance sake sip consume beverages fairly consistently throughout
training, one's ability going depend number things like gastric

running jumping compatible ingesting fluid regular basis whether not
need different intervals every 15 20 minutes. Maybe every five
minutes, maybe every half hour. adjust you, take

much fluid ingest going Galpin equation body weight pounds
divided 30 equals number ounces every 15 20 minutes. course,
can already hear screaming back. us follow
metric system simple translation Galpin equation,
need approximately two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15
20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising
hour. people exercising hour two, probably not that.
workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail

01:02:38 Tool: Baseline Hydration

talk much water, or, generally speaking, much fluid
us drink day much fluid drink, depending specific
activities environment. Now perhaps commonly asked question
topic water comes up, much water need drink? thing
comes question can't. just follow natural thirst. can't.
just pay attention thirsty drink fluids, leads
question is: color urine provide indication
whether not hydrated hydrated hydrating correctly? let
answer things one time backdrop want highlight fact
many many, not dozens, hundreds studies pointing fact
dehydrated, brain doesn't function well. body doesn't
function well. attempting statement throw net around
enormous number studies shown even slight state dehydration,
even two percent dehydration, can lead significant meaningful impact.
negative impact ability to, instance, carry endurance type behaviors.
ability run treadmill stop point feel can't continue
going negatively impacted. is, will able perform less work Less
period time even slightly dehydrated. Likewise, strength reduced


even slight dehydration. Likewise, cognitive performance, including memory,
Focus, creative thinking, flexible thinking different kinds, significantly impaired
states dehydration. Now raises additional question
deserves attention, actually measure dehydration? Now hear
different things like pinch skin top hand, takes
three seconds lay flat, dehydrated. hear hear.
Okay, press fingernail see change color tissue
just fingernail, indeed happen, not go back
original color within one three seconds - dehydrated. hear things like
this: ankles swollen wearing socks, take off socks
can see imprint socks lower limbs. means dehydrated.
hear kind stuff, probably wondering, true
extent true, although can vary quite bit old whether not
skin, top hand tends looser not, depending whether
not you're, leaner not, so, words, not absolutely objective
measures dehydration now true normally can pinch skin top
hand returns normal, Flattened position within one two
three seconds, not within five seconds. decent
probability little bit dehydrated, need ingest fluid that.
press nail see depression causes transition kind
pink color white color, release doesn't go back original
pinkish color within seconds. Well then, chance dehydrated,
not perfect measures dehydration. may surprised learn,
surprised learn basis statements, like even two
percent dehydration State, can lead significant reductions cognitive physical
performance based not direct measures hydration, rather measures
reductions water intake, different thing right, saying ordinarily,
person given body weight, needs x, amount fluid per day get even
just two percent less amount fluid, cognitive physical
Performance impaired rather focusing dehydration tissues. Okay now
might seem like subtle distinction, actually meaningful distinction
think it. However, meaningful distinction can leverage toward
understanding much water fluid need drink day. Now can
really point solid numbers believe not fairly independent body

answer question much fluid need day? referring
fluid not distinguishing water, caffeinated beverages, soda tea
on? will discuss moment can reasonably say every hour
awake first 10 hours day, important first 10 hours
day, consume, average, eight ounces fluid. Now,
using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda
United States? 12 ounces Europe. Sometimes cans soda little bit
smaller. That’s whole discussion unto itself, eight ounces fluid. 236,
just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours
day. Now want clear not mean need ingest eight
ounces 236 milliliters fluid hour every hour first 10 hours day.
certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage

back ask whether not independent activity

2.4 liters water. 10 hours day spans time wake
10 hours later now, setting 10 hour framework? reason setting
10 hour framework turns fluid requirements, even just rest,

talk tap water, take deep breath, not deep gulp
deep breath, researching tap water what’s contained tap water
different regions, not just U.S around world. confess picture pretty
scary one. want clear, not somebody naturally orients towards fear
conspiracy theories, however, researching tap water episode. way
looking peer-reviewed research, meta-analysis reviews, specific research articles
specific hypotheses tested talking experts toxicology

review. Wonderful thorough, although news isn't great,
thorough, great, entitled endocrine disruptors water effects

different sources within world essentially focuses key components.
First all, focuses concentration minerals magnesium calcium

right, hard water water contains magnesium calcium, turns
good thing. water contains magnesium calcium water

tap now. mean shouldn't drink tap water? Well, answer
depends. depend on? Well, depends several things. First
all, highly recommend everybody go online put zip code ask
water analysis water comes tap zip code. something
readily available online, least knowledge, and, unfortunately, no
specific one site can send everyone get in-depth analysis drinking
water comes TAP. However, highly recommend go online
put ZIP code Municipal area code figure whether not water

moderate levels fluoride drinking water. say that? Well,
studies show concentration fluoride drinking water particular


concern thyroid hormone system body now thyroid hormone lot
different roles brain body, thyroid hormone important everything

can get hold fluoride concentrations tap water find whether not
concentrations exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter, will find
even just 0.5 milligrams per liter water can disrupt thyroid Function -
going particular concern people familial genetically related thyroid
issues concerned keeping thyroid hormone levels healthy,
think everybody. telling try get hold data
water comes tap. intend drinking tap water -
probably even don't just know what’s drinking water, local government

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship

just say, 240 milliliters, don't need precise. fluid,
average every hour first 10 hours day, translates average
80 ounces fluid first 10 hours day 2 360 milliliters water,
words approximately two liters water, plus Little bit first 10 hours

certainly not saying that, fact people going find going
ingest water boluses. going perhaps 16 ounces water, 500
milliliters water one portion day maybe couple hours later,


drink water coffee soda beverage
another portion day think, however, important us take step
back ask whether not independent activity

01:11:35 Tool: Hydration & Exercise, Galpin Equation

Now, engaging exercise whether not endurance exercise whether
not resistance, training exercise, going need additional fluids order
maximize effects exercise avoid dehydration, too,
excellent numbers can look excellent arrive
research, largely peeled episode Dr Andy Galpin,

refer so-called Galpin equation. Galpin equation states
take body weight pounds divide 30, will give number
ounces fluid ingest every 15. 20 minutes average, exercising okay,
body weight Pounds divided 30, equals number ounces fluid
consume, average every 15 20 minutes. say average, mean is.

20 minutes Galpin equation, converted metric System going
two milliliters water per kilogram body weight every 15 20 minutes average.
sure number asking whether not hydration prior exercise also
important. absolutely is, follow numbers talked
approximately eight ounces 240 milliliters fluid intake per hour first 10 hours
waking, establish good Baseline hydration heading exercise,
prompts next question. often get, is, amount water
needs consumed according Galpin equation exercise top
separate from, is, replace amount fluid one needs basic level
eight ounces 240 Milliliters answer - sort goes ways. think,
going exercise, obviously follow Galpin equation way again,
don't need ultra specific this. Ballpark figures will ensure
hydration, set little bit higher, perhaps needed ensure
hydration rather less. basically short answer is, exercising

workouts certainly resistant training workouts last hour.
Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s
required Baseline consume according Galpin equation,

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter

harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief

water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,
turns can create hydrogen enriched Water putting tablets magnesium
itself? Small amounts magnesium dissolving water. will give off kind

why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher

using metric system, not ounces, eight ounces fluid approximately 236
milliliters water exist metric system aren't used
thinking ounces, vice versa, just think typical Can soda

somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking

will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing

things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically

realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go

filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,

better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium
calcium. However, encourage take step back consider

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

Well, then, can replace eight ounces 240 milliliters water. That’s

scary one. want clear, not somebody naturally orients towards fear
conspiracy theories, however, researching tap water episode. way
looking peer-reviewed research, meta-analysis reviews, specific research articles
specific hypotheses tested talking experts toxicology
on, pretty Grim picture. Frankly, one looks what’s contained tap
water whether not compounds contained tap water present
sufficient concentrations negatively impact health bad news. much
not tap water believe not? Much not tap water contains things bad
biology cells. silver lining, however, Silver Lining
simple steps inexpensive can used adjust tap water make
not just safe drink, makes perfectly fine drink. That’s good news
get moment. somebody interested whether
not tap water contains things like endocrine disruptors, hormone disruptors can
negatively impact reproductive Health males females Wonderful
review. Wonderful thorough, although news isn't great,
thorough, great, entitled endocrine disruptors water effects
reproductive system. review 2020 analyzes water bunch
different sources within world essentially focuses key components.
First all, focuses concentration minerals magnesium calcium
within water. Many people don't realize this, so-called hard water sounds terrible
right, hard water water contains magnesium calcium, turns
good thing. water contains magnesium calcium water
contains less. looked presence magnesium calcium


going impact pH water general, higher concentrations magnesium

thing review addresses concentration so-called dbps dog Bulldog,
porcupines dbps, disinfection byproducts contained water, obviously
local governments. government wants drinking water clean. don't
want contaminants don't want sewage water. don't want chemical
contaminants going make people immediately sick, treat water, water
treatment plants treat water disinfection products disinfection products
create things called disinfection byproducts presence dbps just
disinfectant byproducts can strongly impact pH water, way changing
concentrations magnesium calcium put differently, believe governments
trying provide people clean water, so, oftentimes introduce
things water not good us. Now. clear dbps can cause

dbps shown disrupt ovarian function, spermatogenesis fertility
outcomes, even concentrations dbps present drinking water. comes
tap now. mean shouldn't drink tap water? Well, answer
depends. depend on? Well, depends several things. First
all, highly recommend everybody go online put zip code ask
water analysis water comes tap zip code. something
readily available online, least knowledge, and, unfortunately, no
specific one site can send everyone get in-depth analysis drinking
water comes TAP. However, highly recommend go online
put ZIP code Municipal area code figure whether not water
contains x amount dbps Y amount dbps. Now, course, going get
bunch values back unless toxicologist, probably not going know
values mean, really looking whether not high low
moderate levels fluoride drinking water. say that? Well,
studies show concentration fluoride drinking water particular


concern thyroid hormone system body now thyroid hormone lot
different roles brain body, thyroid hormone important everything
metabolism levels energy, thyroid levels disrupted thyroid,
receptors disrupted, can lead depression thyroid hormones optimized,
can lead Optimal mood thing, words helps keep
mood elevated. relates everything sleep reproduction thyroid hormones
involved many many things, including bone health tissue Health generally.
essentially, every biological process body impacted thyroid hormone
study like highlight, published 2018, title
study impact drinking water, fluoride, human thyroid hormones. case
control study, not extensive analysis many individuals. However,
shows fluoride, negative impacts thyroid stimulating hormone so-called T3
levels, thyroid hormone T3 T4, even standard concentrations
present important number 0.5 milligrams per liter okay.
can get hold fluoride concentrations tap water find whether not
concentrations exceed 0.5 milligrams per liter, will find
even just 0.5 milligrams per liter water can disrupt thyroid Function -
going particular concern people familial genetically related thyroid
issues concerned keeping thyroid hormone levels healthy,
think everybody. telling try get hold data
water comes tap. intend drinking tap water -
probably even don't just know what’s drinking water, local government
provide information readily available online
particular, think worthwhile address much fluoride present. drinking
water again, don't want create lot scare, not trying trigger fear here.
think, however, way reading review way reading paper just
referred moment ago. Again, links going provided show,
note captions, extensive evidence elevated levels fluoride drinking
water simply not good us now. open whole discussion Florida
drinking water. first place, all,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount
magnesium calcium pH water. somebody
low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,
quote: unquote hardness water. hardness water? know?
better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move

readily lower, pH, acidic water. Well, raises question whether
not different forms water there: reverse osmosis water,
distilled water, double distilled water, deuterium, depleted water, alkaline water,
often called whether not meaningful Health outcomes.
can address items pretty quickly, instance, distilled water double
distilled water essentially distilled is. magnesium calcium removed

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

don't think people need that. However, believe people

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,
turns can create hydrogen enriched Water putting tablets magnesium
itself? Small amounts magnesium dissolving water. will give off kind


gaseous solution. see bunch bubbling there. certainly want dilute

anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first

be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH

simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature

top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting

water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call

anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new

lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't

five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert
asleep, Etc. too, filtration capitalizes mechanical chemical filtration.
mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new

contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds

looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just

occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting

people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new

contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter

harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing

things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,

let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

this, say now started this, not necessarily think
necessary beneficial will talk experience moment.
anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first
part entitled electrolyzed reduced water. Molecular hydrogen exclusive agent
responsible therapeutic effects second part review.
extensive entitled: electrolyze, reduced water number, two safety concerns
Effectiveness source hydrogen water. review uh, linked
show notes points to, health benefits different forms
water hear there, deuterium depleted hydrogen, enrich, Etc seem
boil down, no pun intended no boiling included. say elevation
hydrogen translates really meaningful change elevation PH
occurs you, hydrogen enrich water. Now not lot clinical studies
looking hydrogen Rich water, starting one
like point link published fairly recently,
entitled. Hydrogen-Rich water reduces inflammatory responses prevents apoptosis.
Apoptosis naturally occurring cell death development generally used
describe cell death body. Sometimes can good cell death way,
removing cells need removed again. title paper hydrogen-rich:

hydrogen water can improve certain Health metrics cells,


keeping subjective reports people stated

placebo effect real Powerful effect, just Placebo, although
paper course include placebo group, people didn't know
getting hydrogen Rich water non-hydrogen-rich water. also mention
improvements health metrics observed study
observed individuals older 30 years old. is, don't know
conclusions authors came terms individuals, older 30,
achieved lower levels, or, say, reduced levels inflammation improved
markers aspects biological function? hydrogen water improved
biological antioxidant potential certain cell types again, cell types
mainly focus on? peripheral blood cells particular study? Now,
be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium
filter drink think just fine. If, however, levels magnesium
tap water not value talked earlier. case,
think - can completely understand enriching amount hydrogen

say this. controversial thing suggest structured water
somehow biologically effective better us non-structured water.
number different ways one can create structured water. involve
pretty extensive expensive at-home systems, ranging anywhere couple

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail
physics chemistry water various forms, talked hydration
think That’s main reason many interested concerned
water. also talked contaminants tap water, which, unfortunately,
exist prominent essentially regions world. please get
information about. What’s coming TAP, also want throw one
piece information. That’s really critical learned researching
episode, quality water comes TAP, not just dictated
source comes external home apartment. pipes also
important filter, little mesh sits faucet head also


important. people don't pay attention that, turns lot debris
contaminants can derived little filter people just simply aren't

even just 0.5 milligrams per liter water can disrupt thyroid Function -
going particular concern people familial genetically related thyroid
issues concerned keeping thyroid hormone levels healthy,
think everybody. telling try get hold data
water comes tap. intend drinking tap water -
probably even don't just know what’s drinking water, local government
provide information readily available online
particular, think worthwhile address much fluoride present. drinking
water again, don't want create lot scare, not trying trigger fear here.
think, however, way reading review way reading paper just

drinking water. first place, all,

01:37:18 Tool: Water Filters

leaving aside, seems everybody know much


fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call
intermediate systems systems cost somewhere 200 500 um,
probably one common ones popular ones, so-called Berkey filter
system. filter systems remove things want removed
tap water can higher volumes they're. Typically
countertop units um. don't require plug-in typically, require brief
plug-in electricity going filter many many liters tens liters
water, can always access clean, filtered water time day
night without pour pitcher, mentioned different options
realize people different levels disposable income. far
know, no tablet simple mechanism can purchased transportable.
know pill can just simply throw water remove contaminants
anyone aware one can adequately remove fluoride contaminants.
Please put comment section YouTube: that'd best place
everyone else can see it, hopefully mention different filtration systems
mentioned. Um, give choices hope fall within
range one potentially afford important note filtration, just

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling

falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within

okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good

contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds

fluoride drinking water and, ideally everybody. Yes, everybody filtering
drinking water. Now raises question best filter drinking water -
brings answer - depends couple things. First all, healthy
unhealthy know okay? somebody no health
issues, plenty vigor sleeping well night, no autoimmune
disease you're, not aware health concern minor major. Well then, perhaps
somebody doesn't want filter water. argue why, wouldn't
employ low even zero cost approach filtering water?
going individuals suffering particular ailments brain body,
absolutely filtering drinking water getting drinking
water tap, pretty well established. Now tap water
contains lot disinfectant byproducts well cases exceeding
threshold fluoride, know healthy us. filter tap
water? Well, everything ranging so-called Brita type filter.
can carbon type filters filters essentially put container
compartment can pour water it. goes compartment below.
Will work? sufficient filter disinfectant byproducts? general
answer yes, provided change filters often enough, however, not thought,
unfortunately, not thought filter sufficient fluoride. highly
recommend is, depending budget, go online search at-
home water filters can filter fluoride. number straightforward
inexpensive tools that, don't relationship water
filters things going mention now. want clear that:
no brand code affiliation here. simply trying direct resources will
allow filter tap water safe consume way
meets budget, understanding people different disposable
incomes. range costs going pretty tremendous. just want get
way. First, know water filters can use repeatedly.
will refer picture filters less hundred dollars now
keep mind That’s one-time purchase, except replacement filters
which, fortunately doesn't done often. different filters, will
provide link one found, is, least read lowest possible cost.
so-called clearly filtered water pitcher affinity filtration. filter
can adequately remove fluoride, lead, bpas, glyphosates hormones


harmful things contained tap water. Again, realize
people, even 80 US dollar cost - going prohibitive, realize
purchasing unit can used repeatedly
over. reason lower cost different filtration approaches
will talk moment can't really put drinking water
use say entire week entire month. Um one picture,
going repeatedly pour water pitcher order filter it. Now,
mentioned before, range water filter costs filters can adequately remove
fluoride things want top water immense. fact,
can find um. know whole house water filters are, know, two thousand
dollars again, going filters going garage
laundry room going basically pull piping system
house deliver purified water, technically not purified, That’s removing
contaminants fluoride sinks house. effectively drink
things house. That’s explains higher cost. think
people probably not going disposable income opportunity
include one whole house filters, although means
important you, going call

Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days

people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good

whole tap water thing really want find details pipes

sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,
quote: unquote hardness water. hardness water? know?
better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium
calcium. However, encourage take step back consider
literature. fact, will mention paper particular now published 2019,
describes quote: regulations calcium magnesium hardness drinking water
European Union. Member states turns Europe detailed Water
Analysis That’s present number really high quality scientific Publications.
paper published regulatory, toxicology pharmacology, cite
number different references introduction that, instance, here, quoting

19.4 milligrams per liter. Again, get Water Analysis, can compare
again. values significantly associated decreased likelihood
cardiovascular mortality 25, compared people consuming magnesium content

minds, is: magnesium calcium concentrations relevant

calcium cells? magnesium calcium deficient? Well, turns out.
That’s not case. major effect magnesium calcium water
likely impact things like blood pressure, cardiovascular disease aspects
cellular function turn somewhat cryptic. can make cryptic aspect
clear saying magnesium particular, also calcium

said higher pH water can good you.

01:53:40 Water Temperature

talk higher pH water can good
best fact, inexpensive sources higher, pH magnesium, enhanced simply
tap water contains sufficient magnesium can used accessed. Many
probably wondering whether not can simply boil tap water thereby
decontaminate tap water there. want caution you. turns

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move
gut body bit readily across aquaporin channels,
readily lower, pH, acidic water. Well, raises question whether
not different forms water there: reverse osmosis water,
distilled water, double distilled water, deuterium, depleted water, alkaline water,
often called whether not meaningful Health outcomes.
can address items pretty quickly, instance, distilled water double
distilled water essentially distilled is. magnesium calcium removed
it. recommendation not drink distilled water. may

somebody curious reverse osmosis water can afford filters
reverse osmosis water already pre-filtered, please guest, know drink it.
certainly not trying prevent anyone drinking it. no peer-reviewed

couple reasons, first all, anytime, someone consuming

even objective talk can result consuming other. say

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take
step back ask know really talking about,
turns can create hydrogen enriched Water putting tablets magnesium
itself? Small amounts magnesium dissolving water. will give off kind


gaseous solution. see bunch bubbling there. certainly want dilute

know 5 15 minutes tablet completes dissolving now.
this, say now started this, not necessarily think

anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first
part entitled electrolyzed reduced water. Molecular hydrogen exclusive agent

placebo effect real Powerful effect, just Placebo, although
paper course include placebo group, people didn't know
getting hydrogen Rich water non-hydrogen-rich water. also mention
improvements health metrics observed study
observed individuals older 30 years old. is, don't know
conclusions authors came terms individuals, older 30,
achieved lower levels, or, say, reduced levels inflammation improved

biological antioxidant potential certain cell types again, cell types
mainly focus on? peripheral blood cells particular study? Now,
be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium
filter drink think just fine. If, however, levels magnesium
tap water not value talked earlier. case,
think - can completely understand enriching amount hydrogen

water going far effective absorbed hydrating cells

02:14:05 Structured Water

Now earlier episode discussing structured water fourth phase
water. know number people out. curious whether not ingesting
structured water somehow better us ingesting non-structured water. can
say this. controversial thing suggest structured water
somehow biologically effective better us non-structured water.
number different ways one can create structured water. involve
pretty extensive expensive at-home systems, ranging anywhere couple
hundred dollars couple thousand dollars quite direct one goes
peer-reviewed scientific literature, one will not find is. essentially no
real evidence ingesting structured water leads specific desired biological


outcomes, say sure people still
tremendous experiences ingesting structured water, whether not That’s due
placebo effect real Effect ingesting structured water isn't clear just give
sense stance things like structured water. think
interesting intriguing, scientist absence quality peer-reviewed
data present, can't really suggest people go start ingesting structured
water, adhere claims structured water going Really really
good compared forms water. said, think
interesting open space exploration biological effects structured
water, given fact structured water exist, don't think anyone debates
fact different structures water fourth phase water

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail
physics chemistry water various forms, talked hydration
think That’s main reason many interested concerned
water. also talked contaminants tap water, which, unfortunately,
exist prominent essentially regions world. please get
information about. What’s coming TAP, also want throw one
piece information. That’s really critical learned researching
episode, quality water comes TAP, not just dictated
source comes external home apartment. pipes also
important filter, little mesh sits faucet head also


important. people don't pay attention that, turns lot debris
contaminants can derived little filter people just simply aren't
cleaning. Often enough. not trying tell metal plastic
filter made problem. often not, contaminants showing
water people aren't cleaning filters, often enough fact prior
researching episode. didn't ever think clean filter. looked underneath
faucet filter didn't look particularly filled debris, find
took off - looked side - quite lot debris.
going consume tap water, definitely want consider source, pipes
building, apartment, ones lead right glass jug,
put water also mesh water passes goes
glass jug, also talked much water drink. hope finally resolve

beneficial thinking perspective biologists
chemistry water, hope arriving point episode now
much better understanding chemistry Physics water
way water can powerfully impact biology,


body, mechanisms Signal mechanical changes chemical changes
occur gut brain, Etc. Elsewhere general, mechanical
chemical changes signaled across body invoke different changes. Whether
not know, response immune system make us alert

mean is, run fluid water fluid filter.
filters two things: physically constraining, molecules can
go creating portals pores allow certain size molecules go
not others, almost always, contain certain chemicals right.
filters treated certain chemicals neutralize certain chemicals.
Okay, may wondering how, filter water, know magnesium
calcium can get through, fluoride doesn't That’s filters
cleverly designed order neutralize fluoride prevent large molecules
sediment dirt, Kind easy imagine filtered, also allow
certain small molecules like calcium, small-ish magnesium, smallish
still pass drinking water. wonderful,
means filtering water, using methods talked
still going get whatever magnesium calcium present
water, still adequately removing fluoride disinfectant byproducts.

01:44:18 Tool: Resting Tap Water & Sediment

Now, can't afford options? Okay! Well,
interesting zero cost option, not good ones filtering water,
option think important give options people don't
disposable income purpose filtering Water, draw gallon
five gallons, maybe even tap water tap put
container vessel. one gallon five gallon 10 gallon container
let tap water sit period time allow sediment drop
Bottom. Now might say: well, no sediment, nothing contained
tap water isn't fluoride diluted water, indeed answer
yes. However, evidence letting tap water sit room temperature
outside pipes deliver water can help remove some, not
contaminants water. If, however, filtering water using


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water
Sun, keeping certain containers putting days
get ingested. seems bit extreme want that, guest,
don't think people need that. However, believe people
zero disposable income devote paying kind filtration system tap
water, taking tap water putting container room temperature
keeping room temperature half day day pouring off
top two-thirds water another container consuming water
second container going remove some, not contaminants one
need concerned about, mention Something neglected
mention moments ago, going zero cost option let water
sit bit, want water sit uncapped. Sorry
mentioned uncapped, course, trying keep things falling
water. fact, even put little bit cloth it, don't want things
falling water, want certain things able evaporate off,
also want sediment drop reason Process letting
water sit work many contaminants contained within
water not present source water even treatment
water. rather pipes water arrives glass pot
okay again, infinite number variables.
people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium

describe cell death body. Sometimes can good cell death way,
removing cells need removed again. title paper hydrogen-rich:

weeks. find significant positive benefits reduced inflammation found
changes way analyzing things like interleukin 6
interleukins, markers inflammation. control nicely fact
people still consuming forms water liquid coffee Etc, although
made sure weren't consuming much coffee soda. addition
hydrogen enriched water. paper shows indeed increasing free
hydrogen water can improve certain Health metrics cells,


keeping subjective reports people stated
experienced. say drinking hydrogen Rich water, will tell
fairly inexpensively moment, get subjective experience
energy feeling better quote, unquote. Now keep mind, course
placebo effect real Powerful effect, just Placebo, although
paper course include placebo group, people didn't know
getting hydrogen Rich water non-hydrogen-rich water. also mention
improvements health metrics observed study
observed individuals older 30 years old. is, don't know
conclusions authors came terms individuals, older 30,
achieved lower levels, or, say, reduced levels inflammation improved
markers aspects biological function? hydrogen water improved
biological antioxidant potential certain cell types again, cell types
mainly focus on? peripheral blood cells particular study? Now,
be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium
filter drink think just fine. If, however, levels magnesium

02:16:39 Tool: Water Pipes, Faucet Filter

today discussed water admittedly went lot detail
physics chemistry water various forms, talked hydration
think That’s main reason many interested concerned
water. also talked contaminants tap water, which, unfortunately,
exist prominent essentially regions world. please get
information about. What’s coming TAP, also want throw one

important filter, little mesh sits faucet head also


important. people don't pay attention that, turns lot debris
contaminants can derived little filter people just simply aren't

much better understanding chemistry Physics water
way water can powerfully impact biology,


methods talked moments ago, not need this. Okay,
realize whole world people insist putting water

people living buildings pipes very, old very, clean.
Believe not, people living newer buildings structures new
pipes, seals pipes contain things not good
consume. letting water sit able remove
contaminants present within pipes home build, even pipes
lead home apartment. Now people get really obsessed
whole tap water thing really want find details pipes
sorts know hard metals much magnesium much calcium
present water. ways can test drinking water
sorts things. people realize, including myself, simply not going that.
want know do, tend drink water filtered one
lower cost filters, going consuming lot fluid, will drink certain kinds
fluid later will tell you. experiment sake episode,


looking so-called molecular hydrogen water, sounds fancy esoteric
almost um little wacky, turns out, largely amount

low budget simply just wants spend small amount money try
still drink tap water, absolutely way safely, require
steps.

01:48:13 Tool: “Hard Water”; Magnesium, Calcium & Cardiovascular Health

So, topic magnesium calcium, relates, mentioned earlier,
quote: unquote hardness water. hardness water? know?
better magnesium calcium water less people? Don'T
like taste hard water, prefer taste water less magnesium
calcium. However, encourage take step back consider
literature. fact, will mention paper particular now published 2019,
describes quote: regulations calcium magnesium hardness drinking water
European Union. Member states turns Europe detailed Water
Analysis That’s present number really high quality scientific Publications.
paper published regulatory, toxicology pharmacology, cite
number different references introduction that, instance, here, quoting
statistically significant inverse association magnesium cardiovascular

water, lower cardiovascular mortality, go say highest exposure
category, people consuming drinking water magnesium contents 8.3
19.4 milligrams per liter. Again, get Water Analysis, can compare
again. values significantly associated decreased likelihood

That’s not case. major effect magnesium calcium water
likely impact things like blood pressure, cardiovascular disease aspects
cellular function turn somewhat cryptic. can make cryptic aspect
clear saying magnesium particular, also calcium

little bit concerned maybe clip going taken sent elsewhere,
someone will get impression saying actually want drink high pH
water need Buy expensive, high, pH water turns out. That’s not case
consuming tap water location levels magnesium sufficiently
high tap water again, level magnesium 8.3 19.4 milligrams per
liter water. water coming TAP hard enough. Well
chances don't need enhance pH water change magnesium
concentration? If, however, water drinking tap filtered not,


hope, filtered contains less 8.3 milligrams per liter magnesium. Well, then,
chances pH water going low enough, not going
lending favorable Health components higher pH water
cannotice. not say lower pH AKA, acidic water bad you. didn't say
said higher pH water can good you.

01:53:40 Water Temperature

talk higher pH water can good
best fact, inexpensive sources higher, pH magnesium, enhanced simply
tap water contains sufficient magnesium can used accessed. Many
probably wondering whether not can simply boil tap water thereby
decontaminate tap water there. want caution you. turns
contaminants present water actually made worse heating water
don't want open up. know whole catalog different fears. I, like you,
presume, use water cook, pasta rice omnivore. consume

01:56:42 Water Types: Distilled, Reverse Osmosis, Hydrogen-Enriched

now, understanding hard water, soft water, magnesium, relationship
magnesium, calcium pH water remember earlier
conversation talked higher pH water actually going move

readily lower, pH, acidic water. Well, raises question whether
not different forms water there: reverse osmosis water,
distilled water, double distilled water, deuterium, depleted water, alkaline water,
often called whether not meaningful Health outcomes.

enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher

not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need

better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium

02:03:26 Hydrogen-Enriched Water, Magnesium, Optimize Hydration

However, look hydrogen hydrogen enriched water, really need take

this, say now started this, not necessarily think

anticipation episode, researching water hydrogen Rich
water alkaline Waters became clear me, based
reading fantastic, two-part review. extensive review, entitled least first

be? well? goes back earlier discussion
reduction reactive, oxygen species, so-called Ross's, reductions free radicals
can damage cells, sounding convoluted, can understand
why. However, like study two reviews mentioned
moment ago, studies don't really say hydrogen-rich water what’s
essential. studies really point changes PH water,
enhancing hydrogen water can create leads enhanced, either
absorption ability cells, utilize higher pH water again, not changing
pH Body cells, simply higher pH water, perhaps
accurately State less acidic water. harder. Water contains
magnesium calcium seems readily used cells body
therefore, likely individuals study achieving higher
efficient levels hydration okay. confusing, let clear:
not believe need drink deuterium, depleted water need
drink electrolyzed reduced water. necessarily believe need drink
hydrogen-rich water. However, clear different forms water
better absorbed therefore lead better efficient hydration
therefore can reduce inflammation blood pressure improve number health
metrics. elevated pH different purification water
treatment methods achieve elevated pH not changing pH


cells tissues organs body, actually don't want that. Rather,
elevated pH simply making water less acidic otherwise.
simple takeaway this: tap water contains sufficient magnesium per values
talked earlier, don't think need hydrogen enrich water. do,
however, suggest least analyze water look
professional analysis water, can achieve online filter disinfectant
byproducts fluorides, Etc magnesium or, say sufficiently,
magnesium containing water. Okay, put simply tap water enough magnesium
filter drink think just fine. If, however, levels magnesium
