00:08:08 Vision & Motivation

enter code Huberman checkout. now discussion Dr. Emily
Balcetis. Well, thanks here. - pleasure. - Yeah, looking forward
long time, vision scientist, also interested real-
life tools goal setting motivation, work lands squarely middle
interests. just kick things off, tell us just little bit relationship


perception, particular, see world, goal setting goal
retrieval. vast landscape, expert, turn you. [Emily
laughing] then, time goes on, may additional questions relates
different kinds vision, deal vision motivation?
two things link up? - Yeah, totally, mean, psychologists ask people, like, "What
help make progress goals?" say kinds things,
couple things always pop top, is, "Try shock encouraging ways,
self-pep talks," or, "I remind important job," or, "I'll put
Post-it notes around constantly nagging need do."
common tactics people use, notice really
effortful, constantly remind yourself, constantly talk yourself,
create Post-it notes, remember look them, takes lot
time effort commitment, surprise people burn out, right?
exciting work goal first set it, might make initial progress,
eventually get not even halfway point things get real, [laughing]
things challenging, fall wayside. that's, think,
tactics go-to strategies goal maintain. double
sided, putting much try advance thing originally
set accomplish. then, team, trying think of, like, "Well,
strategies don't require much effort, can automate, can take
advantage already happening within ourselves, within body, within
mind, might overcome one challenges, that'll easier, automated?"
started land idea vision, right? look world
without even thinking it, us sighted, thought, "You know
what? strategies can use look world different way
can automate might help us overcome obstacles, make progress
goals, maybe literally see opportunities hadn't able see
before." started playing around idea visual illusions see, like, "Do
people even know ways seeing things around them? Can tweak
that, room intervention? Can encourage people take new way
looking see things hadn't seen before?" really opened us
trying look intersection vision science motivation science. -
great, always say, here, strongly biased vision scientist,
vision dominant sense navigate world survive. love idea


real-world, realtime access vision. certainly familiar goal setting
Post-its magnets refrigerators can immediate impact, time,
become part visual landscape overlook them, know,
vision scientists, something stably environment, eventually, blind it,

00:11:37 Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise

makes good sense. published number studies area,
maybe highlight more, consider important
findings area people can adjust vision order meet goals
quickly efficiently, perhaps also arrive goals different
visual perceptions, that, way, may divide us highly motivated less
motivated people, words, link vision motivation,
can leverage order better reach goals? - Totally, started thinking
about, "What goals important people struggle
most?" asked hundreds, thousands people new year's resolutions
are, looked polls kind work, regardless
look, ask, ask it, people's number-one goal
something related health, right? lose weight, exercise more, get out, get
steps, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing. like number-one goal
every January 1st. able accomplish goal, think drop
[laughing] little bit rankings, doesn't really hard. thought,
"I wonder way us make progress that, helping people
exercise better, often, stick longer, make progress there?" know
diets don't work. [laughing] don't diets work? reason self-talk
doesn't work, go it, full bore, hardcore, requires major commitment
effort lifestyle change. again, looking something might
easier that, produce big payoff, right? golden ticket, [laughing]
something requires less effort bigger payoff. one first things
go Brooklyn, old armory building, used military armory
space, yeah. - think know building. - Yeah, beautiful. - beautiful building,
now, houses lot businesses, right? plants walls, one? -
Yeah, businesses, couple armories around boroughs
around New York City, one Brooklyn particular now YMCA, right?


family YMCA, within beautiful old redbrick building used military
establishment long, long ago. really cool that, one winter afternoon,
somebody invited me, physical therapist said, "Hey, come
check happening here, interest exercise trying find new
ways helping people, new tactics can add tool belt, think
going find interesting people working there." showed up, look
around, families, new moms, kids, moms trying get kids burn
off winter energy have, people look like just
their, every couple days, going run. people look like
training team, physical therapist introduced to,
coach team. bunch people sitting ground,
hard pressed know high school student group,
who, turns out, fastest runners world. One
people last Olympics showed up, won gold medal 400
meter. looks them, mean, course, bodies better shape
mine, nothing so, course, not wearing medals,
nothing pretentious walking around anything like that,
lead know, like, "This person's amazing, probably insight
don't have." got introduced knew people
part pretty elite training team happened work family gym,
chance talk about, "What strategies use?" Now, not
elite runner, recently baby, not really runner right now all,
thought, "When people running, bet hyper aware everything
going surroundings. relative competition,
happening peripheral vision, going side, behind them,
front them? probably master sense, master visual plan
point time, probably makes elite." started asking
them, "Is case, really pay attention surroundings,
behind you, side?" said, "No," said, "No, sometimes
that, mistake, doesn't work me." surprising
totally went intuition likely contributes
success. said instead hyper focused, assume
narrowed focus attention, almost like spotlight shining target. Now,
running short distance, target might literally finish line, line


trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something

that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else

swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going

would've nearly every person situation,

might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative

obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes

looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication

counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant

eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight

health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank

enter code Huberman checkout. now discussion Dr. Emily
Balcetis. Well, thanks here. - pleasure. - Yeah, looking forward
long time, vision scientist, also interested real-
life tools goal setting motivation, work lands squarely middle
interests. just kick things off, tell us just little bit relationship


perception, particular, see world, goal setting goal
retrieval. vast landscape, expert, turn you. [Emily
laughing] then, time goes on, may additional questions relates
different kinds vision, deal vision motivation?
two things link up? - Yeah, totally, mean, psychologists ask people, like, "What
help make progress goals?" say kinds things,
couple things always pop top, is, "Try shock encouraging ways,
self-pep talks," or, "I remind important job," or, "I'll put
Post-it notes around constantly nagging need do."
common tactics people use, notice really
effortful, constantly remind yourself, constantly talk yourself,
create Post-it notes, remember look them, takes lot
time effort commitment, surprise people burn out, right?
exciting work goal first set it, might make initial progress,
eventually get not even halfway point things get real, [laughing]
things challenging, fall wayside. that's, think,
tactics go-to strategies goal maintain. double
sided, putting much try advance thing originally
set accomplish. then, team, trying think of, like, "Well,
strategies don't require much effort, can automate, can take
advantage already happening within ourselves, within body, within
mind, might overcome one challenges, that'll easier, automated?"
started land idea vision, right? look world
without even thinking it, us sighted, thought, "You know
what? strategies can use look world different way
can automate might help us overcome obstacles, make progress
goals, maybe literally see opportunities hadn't able see
before." started playing around idea visual illusions see, like, "Do
people even know ways seeing things around them? Can tweak
that, room intervention? Can encourage people take new way
looking see things hadn't seen before?" really opened us
trying look intersection vision science motivation science. -
great, always say, here, strongly biased vision scientist,

00:11:37 Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise

makes good sense. published number studies area,
maybe highlight more, consider important
findings area people can adjust vision order meet goals
quickly efficiently, perhaps also arrive goals different
visual perceptions, that, way, may divide us highly motivated less
motivated people, words, link vision motivation,
can leverage order better reach goals? - Totally, started thinking
about, "What goals important people struggle
most?" asked hundreds, thousands people new year's resolutions
are, looked polls kind work, regardless
look, ask, ask it, people's number-one goal
something related health, right? lose weight, exercise more, get out, get
steps, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing. like number-one goal
every January 1st. able accomplish goal, think drop
[laughing] little bit rankings, doesn't really hard. thought,
"I wonder way us make progress that, helping people
exercise better, often, stick longer, make progress there?" know
diets don't work. [laughing] don't diets work? reason self-talk
doesn't work, go it, full bore, hardcore, requires major commitment
effort lifestyle change. again, looking something might
easier that, produce big payoff, right? golden ticket, [laughing]
something requires less effort bigger payoff. one first things
go Brooklyn, old armory building, used military armory
space, yeah. - think know building. - Yeah, beautiful. - beautiful building,
now, houses lot businesses, right? plants walls, one? -
Yeah, businesses, couple armories around boroughs
around New York City, one Brooklyn particular now YMCA, right?


family YMCA, within beautiful old redbrick building used military
establishment long, long ago. really cool that, one winter afternoon,
somebody invited me, physical therapist said, "Hey, come
check happening here, interest exercise trying find new
ways helping people, new tactics can add tool belt, think
going find interesting people working there." showed up, look
around, families, new moms, kids, moms trying get kids burn
off winter energy have, people look like just
their, every couple days, going run. people look like
training team, physical therapist introduced to,
coach team. bunch people sitting ground,
hard pressed know high school student group,
who, turns out, fastest runners world. One
people last Olympics showed up, won gold medal 400
meter. looks them, mean, course, bodies better shape
mine, nothing so, course, not wearing medals,
nothing pretentious walking around anything like that,
lead know, like, "This person's amazing, probably insight
don't have." got introduced knew people
part pretty elite training team happened work family gym,
chance talk about, "What strategies use?" Now, not
elite runner, recently baby, not really runner right now all,
thought, "When people running, bet hyper aware everything
going surroundings. relative competition,
happening peripheral vision, going side, behind them,
front them? probably master sense, master visual plan
point time, probably makes elite." started asking
them, "Is case, really pay attention surroundings,
behind you, side?" said, "No," said, "No, sometimes
that, mistake, doesn't work me." surprising
totally went intuition likely contributes
success. said instead hyper focused, assume
narrowed focus attention, almost like spotlight shining target. Now,
running short distance, target might literally finish line, line


trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak

sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,

deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks

visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning

manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes

vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states

science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,
wonderful resource,

perception, particular, see world, goal setting goal
retrieval. vast landscape, expert, turn you. [Emily
laughing] then, time goes on, may additional questions relates
different kinds vision, deal vision motivation?
two things link up? - Yeah, totally, mean, psychologists ask people, like, "What
help make progress goals?" say kinds things,
couple things always pop top, is, "Try shock encouraging ways,
self-pep talks," or, "I remind important job," or, "I'll put
Post-it notes around constantly nagging need do."
common tactics people use, notice really
effortful, constantly remind yourself, constantly talk yourself,
create Post-it notes, remember look them, takes lot
time effort commitment, surprise people burn out, right?
exciting work goal first set it, might make initial progress,
eventually get not even halfway point things get real, [laughing]
things challenging, fall wayside. that's, think,
tactics go-to strategies goal maintain. double
sided, putting much try advance thing originally
set accomplish. then, team, trying think of, like, "Well,
strategies don't require much effort, can automate, can take
advantage already happening within ourselves, within body, within
mind, might overcome one challenges, that'll easier, automated?"
started land idea vision, right? look world
without even thinking it, us sighted, thought, "You know
what? strategies can use look world different way
can automate might help us overcome obstacles, make progress
goals, maybe literally see opportunities hadn't able see
before." started playing around idea visual illusions see, like, "Do
people even know ways seeing things around them? Can tweak
that, room intervention? Can encourage people take new way
looking see things hadn't seen before?" really opened us
trying look intersection vision science motivation science. -
great, always say, here, strongly biased vision scientist,
vision dominant sense navigate world survive. love idea


real-world, realtime access vision. certainly familiar goal setting
Post-its magnets refrigerators can immediate impact, time,
become part visual landscape overlook them, know,
vision scientists, something stably environment, eventually, blind it,

00:11:37 Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise

makes good sense. published number studies area,
maybe highlight more, consider important
findings area people can adjust vision order meet goals
quickly efficiently, perhaps also arrive goals different
visual perceptions, that, way, may divide us highly motivated less
motivated people, words, link vision motivation,
can leverage order better reach goals? - Totally, started thinking
about, "What goals important people struggle
most?" asked hundreds, thousands people new year's resolutions
are, looked polls kind work, regardless
look, ask, ask it, people's number-one goal
something related health, right? lose weight, exercise more, get out, get
steps, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing. like number-one goal
every January 1st. able accomplish goal, think drop
[laughing] little bit rankings, doesn't really hard. thought,
"I wonder way us make progress that, helping people
exercise better, often, stick longer, make progress there?" know
diets don't work. [laughing] don't diets work? reason self-talk
doesn't work, go it, full bore, hardcore, requires major commitment
effort lifestyle change. again, looking something might
easier that, produce big payoff, right? golden ticket, [laughing]
something requires less effort bigger payoff. one first things
go Brooklyn, old armory building, used military armory
space, yeah. - think know building. - Yeah, beautiful. - beautiful building,
now, houses lot businesses, right? plants walls, one? -
Yeah, businesses, couple armories around boroughs
around New York City, one Brooklyn particular now YMCA, right?


family YMCA, within beautiful old redbrick building used military
establishment long, long ago. really cool that, one winter afternoon,
somebody invited me, physical therapist said, "Hey, come
check happening here, interest exercise trying find new
ways helping people, new tactics can add tool belt, think
going find interesting people working there." showed up, look
around, families, new moms, kids, moms trying get kids burn
off winter energy have, people look like just
their, every couple days, going run. people look like
training team, physical therapist introduced to,
coach team. bunch people sitting ground,
hard pressed know high school student group,
who, turns out, fastest runners world. One
people last Olympics showed up, won gold medal 400
meter. looks them, mean, course, bodies better shape
mine, nothing so, course, not wearing medals,
nothing pretentious walking around anything like that,
lead know, like, "This person's amazing, probably insight
don't have." got introduced knew people
part pretty elite training team happened work family gym,
chance talk about, "What strategies use?" Now, not
elite runner, recently baby, not really runner right now all,
thought, "When people running, bet hyper aware everything
going surroundings. relative competition,
happening peripheral vision, going side, behind them,
front them? probably master sense, master visual plan
point time, probably makes elite." started asking
them, "Is case, really pay attention surroundings,
behind you, side?" said, "No," said, "No, sometimes
that, mistake, doesn't work me." surprising
totally went intuition likely contributes
success. said instead hyper focused, assume
narrowed focus attention, almost like spotlight shining target. Now,
running short distance, target might literally finish line, line


trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove

just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic

might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight

anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons

puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

Post-its magnets refrigerators can immediate impact, time,

vision scientists, something stably environment, eventually, blind it,

00:11:37 Tool: Narrowing Visual Focus & Improving Exercise

makes good sense. published number studies area,
maybe highlight more, consider important
findings area people can adjust vision order meet goals
quickly efficiently, perhaps also arrive goals different
visual perceptions, that, way, may divide us highly motivated less
motivated people, words, link vision motivation,
can leverage order better reach goals? - Totally, started thinking
about, "What goals important people struggle
most?" asked hundreds, thousands people new year's resolutions
are, looked polls kind work, regardless
look, ask, ask it, people's number-one goal
something related health, right? lose weight, exercise more, get out, get
steps, mental wellbeing, physical wellbeing. like number-one goal
every January 1st. able accomplish goal, think drop
[laughing] little bit rankings, doesn't really hard. thought,
"I wonder way us make progress that, helping people
exercise better, often, stick longer, make progress there?" know
diets don't work. [laughing] don't diets work? reason self-talk
doesn't work, go it, full bore, hardcore, requires major commitment
effort lifestyle change. again, looking something might
easier that, produce big payoff, right? golden ticket, [laughing]
something requires less effort bigger payoff. one first things
go Brooklyn, old armory building, used military armory
space, yeah. - think know building. - Yeah, beautiful. - beautiful building,
now, houses lot businesses, right? plants walls, one? -
Yeah, businesses, couple armories around boroughs
around New York City, one Brooklyn particular now YMCA, right?


family YMCA, within beautiful old redbrick building used military
establishment long, long ago. really cool that, one winter afternoon,
somebody invited me, physical therapist said, "Hey, come
check happening here, interest exercise trying find new
ways helping people, new tactics can add tool belt, think
going find interesting people working there." showed up, look
around, families, new moms, kids, moms trying get kids burn
off winter energy have, people look like just
their, every couple days, going run. people look like
training team, physical therapist introduced to,
coach team. bunch people sitting ground,
hard pressed know high school student group,
who, turns out, fastest runners world. One
people last Olympics showed up, won gold medal 400
meter. looks them, mean, course, bodies better shape
mine, nothing so, course, not wearing medals,
nothing pretentious walking around anything like that,
lead know, like, "This person's amazing, probably insight
don't have." got introduced knew people
part pretty elite training team happened work family gym,
chance talk about, "What strategies use?" Now, not
elite runner, recently baby, not really runner right now all,
thought, "When people running, bet hyper aware everything
going surroundings. relative competition,
happening peripheral vision, going side, behind them,
front them? probably master sense, master visual plan
point time, probably makes elite." started asking
them, "Is case, really pay attention surroundings,
behind you, side?" said, "No," said, "No, sometimes
that, mistake, doesn't work me." surprising
totally went intuition likely contributes
success. said instead hyper focused, assume
narrowed focus attention, almost like spotlight shining target. Now,
running short distance, target might literally finish line, line


trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've

sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,

important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look

great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach

effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed

sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see

family YMCA, within beautiful old redbrick building used military
establishment long, long ago. really cool that, one winter afternoon,
somebody invited me, physical therapist said, "Hey, come
check happening here, interest exercise trying find new
ways helping people, new tactics can add tool belt, think
going find interesting people working there." showed up, look
around, families, new moms, kids, moms trying get kids burn
off winter energy have, people look like just
their, every couple days, going run. people look like
training team, physical therapist introduced to,
coach team. bunch people sitting ground,
hard pressed know high school student group,
who, turns out, fastest runners world. One
people last Olympics showed up, won gold medal 400
meter. looks them, mean, course, bodies better shape
mine, nothing so, course, not wearing medals,
nothing pretentious walking around anything like that,
lead know, like, "This person's amazing, probably insight
don't have." got introduced knew people
part pretty elite training team happened work family gym,
chance talk about, "What strategies use?" Now, not
elite runner, recently baby, not really runner right now all,
thought, "When people running, bet hyper aware everything
going surroundings. relative competition,
happening peripheral vision, going side, behind them,
front them? probably master sense, master visual plan
point time, probably makes elite." started asking
them, "Is case, really pay attention surroundings,
behind you, side?" said, "No," said, "No, sometimes
that, mistake, doesn't work me." surprising
totally went intuition likely contributes
success. said instead hyper focused, assume
narrowed focus attention, almost like spotlight shining target. Now,
running short distance, target might literally finish line, line


trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment

plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something

wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going

would've nearly every person situation,

might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank

trying cross. longer distance, set subgoals, like person,
shorts person ahead trying beat, choose sort
stable landmark, like sign pass by. spotlight shining just
that, blinders sides face, paying attention to,
really narrowed scope attention. strategy elite
athletes said used, better rather slower ones
used more. thought, "Oh, something can play with, right?
elite [laughing] accomplished, visual strategy isn't necessarily
something perfect physical condition able adopt,
wonder, can help rest us aren't competing Olympic gold
no chance ever getting one, want exercise better, better
time it, maintain commitment exercise goal might have,
might otherwise, February March, giving on, said
beginning January?" really work started, might call
focus groups case studies [laughing] incredible athletes.
studies, looking people aren't Olympic athletes, competitive
New York Road Runners runners, running races?
found people better pace, faster pace, better time, use
narrowed strategy often expansive open scope attention.
seemed correlation better performance among wider swath
hundreds runners, competitively, still, like person
sitting next office, yourself, right? often
consistently adopted that, technique narrowed focus
attention, seemed better runs. started
thinking like, "Okay, people aren't competitive runners? like
mom, [laughing] can that, trying get back
bandwagon exercise more, tactic can teach people?" answer yes,
can tell people Olympic athletes doing, can tell
New York Road Runners runners doing, just using language
just used you, right? "Imagine spotlight shining just target,
choose something ahead, stop sign two blocks can just see,
imagine blinders not really paying attention people
passing by, buildings, garbage cans, trucks
road, tune focus target, hit it, choose another


one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight

anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons

puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic

one, right? Sort recalibrate, choose next goal." test, like, "Can
people that?" mean, listening right now, probably imagining
experience too, answer yes, like, "I can imagine that, know words
mean, can that." work found too, people can that,
say loud, "What captured attention?" course,
"Sometimes something periphery, like movement, captures gaze
pulled instant, can refocus adopt narrowed
attention." Now, one first studies teach strategy juxtapose
compare group said, "Just look around naturally, might see
finish line ahead things periphery, whatever eyes want
do, whatever think going work best, feel free that, tell us
looking at." gave finish line, created sort exercise
moderately challenging, possible. put ankle weights accounted
15% body weight, told lift knees up, sort high stepping finish
line. challenging do, said, "It's indicator overall
health fitness." people narrowed focus attention
just looking expansively naturally. found
people trained, just everyday normal people moderately challenging
exercise, able move 27% faster. exercise quickly,
said hurt 17% less. exercise exactly people,
set weight, [laughing] set distance, lab space,
constrained environment, everybody sort circumstance, yet
experience really different, helped move faster, burn calories higher
rate, right? Exercise efficiently, amount time put going produce
better physical outcome, also, didn't hurt them, right? saying, "It doesn't
hurt much." really excited that, right? meant
strategy, use people not elite athletes. easily
adopted, quick training session, right, can teach people look world
different way. Again, narrowed attention different whatever
naturally, comparison group, big outcome, big difference
way engaged exercise. first work did,
then, since then, done, don't know, dozens studies look at, "Well,
happens else can playing around this?" - Yeah,
impressive differences



00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second

wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-

cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain

specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate

brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention

00:21:39 Adjusting Visual Attention & Perceived Fatigue

consequence narrowing visual attention. Couple questions actual
practice narrowing attention, indication whether not subjects
constantly updating visual attention? instance, say goal line
view, literally, beginning, imagine just holding visual attention
goal line, oval track, trajectory along trail, city,
often think updating visual aperture setting visual goal?
imagine energetic expense that, meaning, wouldn't
want every crack sidewalk, unless cracks sidewalk
far apart. - [laughing] Right. - think, point,
exhausting. optimal strategy semi-optimal strategy? - Yeah,
Olympic athletes started interviewing, tended sprinters,
often sprinters, short-distance sprinters. said like, "Yes, narrow
assume expansive focus," not going far, right?
fast humanly possible, not going far.
started asking question too, about, like, "Well, wouldn't tiring?"
answer yes, start look at, well, people aren't sprinters,
accomplished, long-distance runners, find do,
using narrowed attention strategy strategically, increases use,
use often race progresses, really start major
switch [laughing] halfway point say like 10-kilometer run. people
seasoned runners, really start making switch looking
halfway through, often, frequently
intentionally adopting narrowed focus attention last couple miles
run, maybe resources starting get thin, maybe
motivation starting fade. tipping point middle is, kind goal,
people struggle most, doubling strategy
know effective. first, longer-distance runners not using
narrowed strategy, looking expansively, think that, well, first
all, distraction [laughing] thing, useful. Not necessarily distracting
themselves, people still trying hold pace jostle among probably
concentrated group runners, strategy use, sort


wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,

wean off race goes through. particularly effective looking
last push, right? last push get finish line, might
literally neck neck somebody trying just beat out,
tired, know last push, don't want drop off, want
push hard finish line, people using peak
level intensity. - see, yeah. me, makes total sense work, without
going rabbit hole visual neuroscience, something another time,
vergence eye movements, bring eyes visual target,
clear brainstem circuitry alertness gets engaged greater degree.
thing know focus object, optics
eye change

00:25:14 Tool: Visual Focus “Spotlight”

narrow visual field. brings about, detailed question,
sure audience wondering, say focused goal line intermediate
goal, focusing specific point kind entire horizon goal?
finish line indeed line. course, impossible know
someone actually mind's eye, people report this?
see literally spotlight? so, broad spot? - Yeah,
length [laughing] aperture rather maybe diameter sphere size
it? interviews people, sort focus group studies, seems like
like circular point. fact teaching people, training
do, rather going broadly, looking across line left right,
encouraging imagine circle light shining target. Now,
course, finish line line, staying lane, track, right?
can imagine circle shining just lane cross
finish line, stop sign, imagine circle light illuminating that.
teaching people use seems effective
maintain focus rather sort pulled engage peripheral vision.
amazing people, runners history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson,
one first female marathon competitors, won multiple marathons.
Canadian, think won, feel free correct me, like 10 marathons life.
talks sort not assuming wide narrow, [laughing] wide not


deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.

wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic

deep tall attentional focus. talks about, like, "Finding shorts somebody
ahead focusing shorts," passes them, resetting
goal. interviews done runners magazines, talks
terms circle attention. - Mm, think experienced little bit,
visiting New York now interview, runners seem
competitive, recreational runners seem competitive. People walking
street seem competitive. - Yeah. [laughing] - walking near pace somebody,
quickly speed up. speed up, speed up. - Yeah. - think
studies walking speed different cities, New York ranks among
fastest walkers around. won't mention slowest-walking cities. [Emily laughing]
'Cause don't want cast judgments. fascinating, again, makes total
sense based way visual system

00:27:57 Tool: Goal Gradient Hypothesis, Visual Spotlight Increase Effort

measures space time. - Yeah. - Something maybe get little bit later,
curious whether not whole thing works reverse well. Meaning,
people motivated exercise, think way naturally? People
averse exercise find hard get motivated exercise, view
world differently, literally? - Yeah, yeah, much can say this,
[laughing] humor me, give couple different stories can
answer that. - Please. - don't deep dive vision science, which,
course, capable doing, can share animal
studies work kind first started. 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice
labs. looking, first models human behavior people
trying understand motivation, motivation science within. deprive
poor rats mice food water, motivated get it.
[laughing] hungry thirsty practice running maze
knew find food water, whatever looking
for. researchers studying pace movement
maze. rats going maze, found even though
rats hungry expend limited caloric energy make
finish line, actually ran faster closer got finish line.
finish line became nearer them, actually used resources, probably


suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

suboptimally, make sure crossed finish line got reward.
first early work showing proximity goal increases
investment resources people, animals use meet goal, even
don't much spare. mice, kind thing, actually
little harnesses them, looking hard mice pull try
make food water trying get. deal, closer
got getting reward, harder pulling, even though didn't
much energy spare already used getting finish
line. early animal research 1940s, 1950s, spurred whole wave
work humans. humans thing? Even tired, can
see can feel goal close, double work even harder
cross finish line, either literal finish line, talking exercise,
metaphorical finish line talking kind goal people might
have? answer yes, called goal gradient hypothesis, closer
get goal, generally, harder people animals work finish goal.
led us think, "Okay, rats, mice, people seeing
finish line, right? maybe seeing finish line, seeing
reward, seeing goal hoping accomplish, leading try
harder, invest can finish off. induce illusion
proximity? can induce visual illusion, visual experience approximates
real rats mice actually experiencing got closer?"
happening, happening visually create narrowed focus
attention, tell people, "Imagine spotlight shorts person
ahead, stop sign seeing," induces illusion proximity
responsible people trying harder, walking faster, feeling defied
expectations wasn't bad thought be. things like
measure, like measure visual experience, like, "How far away finish line?"
course, can ask report feet, "How many feet it?" Ah,
challenging, right? Nobody really knows three feet versus four feet really looks like,
do, can ask many feet is. also use measures
of, like visual matching measures know distance finish line looks
far away target, matching visual experiences.
know inducing narrowed focus attention creating illusion proximity,
goal looks closer them. kinds downstream, motivational


psychological effects happen feeling like closer, visually
misperceiving space, can really positive consequence. first
question was, "Which way go? go ways, people better
runners happen thing?" Yes, research shows that, they,
whatever reason, happened upon strategy continued practice it, tended
better runners. also know experiments lab,
take people don't know strategies, flip coin,
randomly assign either learn strategy use whatever comes
naturally them, can create illusion proximity, direct causal
impact improving performance exercising. yes, goes
ways, can also teach don't just rely luck,

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,

plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative

obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.

anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons

puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight

anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic

00:35:00 Defining Goals vs. Accomplishing Goals, Dream Boards & Goal Lists

Again, athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. pressing
question mind is, can we, I, us, use strategy make starting
line goal point? lot people, not going start finish,
getting start. say, here, estimating, 15% content
social media motivation get motivated things. Neurochemicals
like dopamine, course, heart motivation. mind, making strong
links visual aperture effects goal lines dopamine
also dive into. simple question is, can use finish line strategy make
start line goal get system engaged motivated?
physiology, physiological changes, say, reflect idea maybe just
visually focusing start line actually get excited opposed
make less excited engage effort? - Mm-hmm, certainly vision science
tied first stage goal setting, like identifying goal
first place taking first steps. lot people's go-to strategies involve
vision vision boards, dream boards, Post-it notes, right? creating
sort visual representation want accomplish, "Where
want five years, 10 days, 10 years?" Whatever timeline
working under. idea vision boards dream boards you, almost like
scrapbook, [laughing] collect visual icons reflect want motivate
yourself. really common tactic people use, not bad that, right?
people, just even knowing want life major accomplishment,
defining goal can really challenging people, strategy works
involves visual experience, right? not just, people aren't saying like, "Why
don't just sit around imagine want life like 10 years?"
strategy people suggesting like, "No, cut pictures, put board
stick bathroom mirror see every day," right? - make list. -
make list, yeah. - People big lists, lot friends like,
"Have made list?" list things insist context
fitness, relationship, job, et cetera, et cetera, seems common now,
yeah. - Yeah, totally, idea, like, "Write down," right? telling you, "Write
down," or, "Create visual manifestation it." yeah, effective


identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,

identifying want, may not actually effective helping meet
goal, get job done. colleagues mine New York University probed,
"Well, why, that? just thinking want life sort
putting vicariously shoes, imagining life will like can
accomplish everything list, doesn't work?" Well, first all, "Does
work?" answer no, "And not work?" happens,
colleagues, Gabriele Oettingen research team found going
dreaming or, "Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z
done," like goal satisfied. "I identified want,
experienced it, even just imaginary way, positive experience
thinking about, well, great life going get thing done,"
start sort rest laurels. actually measured systolic blood pressure
heart rate, found people that, go experience of,
"Visualizing great life will get X, Y Z done," systolic blood
pressure, bottom number blood pressure reading, decreases. Okay, now,
finding ways relax, especially New York, right? constantly living
high level stimulation, like, "Cool, great, maybe just think
awesome life will get bucket list done," motivation scientists
know systolic blood pressure actually indicator body's readiness get
act, something. Now, can going walk, going
run, hitting gym, can also things like math problems, [laughing] right?
Even something just mental, systolic blood pressure actually goes
anticipation body mind needing something, taking first steps
goal. helps us understand like, "Okay, just created dream
board, vision board, put psychologically space goal satisfied,
bad blood pressure goes down?" means body chilling
out, like, "All right, cool, just accomplished something pretty major," right? "I actually
now don't physiological resources ready take first step right now
something that." pretty monumental finding motivation
scientists, understand creating dream boards, vision boards, to-do
lists, might actually backfire, creation goal
satisfaction goal, people understandably give time
just enjoy positive experience. - much "The Secret". - [Emily] Yeah, exactly,
[laughing] exactly. - guess now "The Secret" folks will come pitchforks,


but. - try never say name, [laughing] right? reason. - Well, not afraid
say name, mean, imagine certain strategies might work people,
everything saying, again, consistent know
physiology dopamine circuits motivation. good friend perhaps
incidentally, perhaps not, cardiologist major university, said one
major errors people make book writing completion will tell people
going write book people will say, "Oh, definitely write book,
everyone's going love book," never end writing it. theory
get much dopamine reward immediate feedback,
protection never book criticized, never write book.

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning
sessions, need simultaneously think couple things. One
going get there? take abstract, take idyllic visual
iconography start thinking practical day day. need break
manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard


going be, ways going fail? going jazz up?
going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,
probably going shy time, thin resources, maybe experiencing
anxiety hijacks brain not functioning optimal level judgment
decision making. want already snap next step place can
just hop it, right? not going best thinking crisis mode,
don't already used resources advance come
plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,

00:41:28 Tool: Setting Better Goals & Identify Obstacles

sure exceptions this, guess raises question, better
strategy? - Yeah, not saying people enjoy dream board creation
stop doing, not take-home message here. - Nightmare board. -
[laughing] Oh, definitely not that, no. - Okay, okay. - enough anxiety fear
world, don't need encourage it. process goal setting
shouldn't stop articulating goal is. point trying
figure out, "What want do, vision future?" planning

manageable goals, not just, "My 10-year plan myself," but, "My two-week
plan, can accomplish next two weeks two weeks going
set right trajectory?" probably not surprising anybody [laughing]
thinking about, "How set goals better?" Plan big picture, think big picture
abstractly, also break concretely, probably not surprising,
important aspect goal setting process. Then, again, Gabriele Oettingen
department identified third often overlooked underappreciated stage
happen goal setting process, thinking obstacles
stand way success, that, will actually help improve motivation long
run. sometimes people think counterintuitive, "You're saying want
increase motivation, motivation, need think hard

going help get things get hard?" like
coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.

that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else

single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going

would've nearly every person situation,

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean

tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well

mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic

coming plan B, plan C, plan D, advance actually experiencing that.
boat boat started sink, not time want start
looking life jackets. already want know one can go right
away. thing goal setting, want know, "What
working towards? going get there? experience obstacle,
going it." may never experience obstacle, do,

plan B plan C. Michael Phelps, incredible athlete, right? something
coach routinely incorporated training. love story
that, back 2008, hot first time international stage.
Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps brink something no one else
history Olympic Games ever done, win eight gold medals
single Olympiad. time story, already won seven just
200 fly front no one else ever done, win
eighth gold medal. fly thing, right? should've easy, no-brainer,
going win this, going break Olympic history. soon dove
pool, goggles started leak. time done three lengths pool,
just flip around come back starting line slash finish line, back
edge. time happened, goggles completely filled water
swimming blind. would've panicked, would've sunk bottom pool,
wouldn't even pool honest, not swimmer, definitely not going
Olympics, him, didn't, wasn't moment panic, like probably
would've nearly every person situation,
foreshadowed kind possible failure. imagined obstacle hitting
advance, not even just imagined it, practiced it, "What will do?" routinely
practiced swimming goggles not fully secured face, coach notoriously
rip goggles off head, smash 'em ground maybe dramatic
effect something, didn't even goggles possible grab


practice. foreshadowed possibility solution, "If
goggles start leak, will do," case, "start counting strokes, make
through." knew exactly many strokes take get one
end pool other, started counting strokes. won race, 200
fly, won eighth gold medal go win 15 career.
might not swimmers, might not aspire Olympic-level performance,
love example think helps sort demystify give us alternative
perspective importance motivational reasons thinking
obstacles advance, thinking ways, two, three, four ways plan
might go awry actually effective helping us overcome obstacle

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-

cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,

specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate

sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,

can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see

00:46:38 Vision Unique, Challenging Visual System, Realistic Goals & Micro-
Goals

might otherwise lead us throw towel. - beautiful example. going
springboard off example ask question also mind,
is, really anything special vision? example just gave,
indeed vision Michael Phelps deprived counting strokes.
Counting another form incremental measurement, nervous system, obviously.
others, sensation hands smacking water
breaking surface water, number different variables
metrics one use. imagine setting a, say, three-mile
run, which, me, decent-distanced run, one times week, also
not runner, try complete runs times week, slow pace,
just health. [Emily laughing] count every step, kind
exhausting, knew three miles was, going estimate here, don't know,
couple thousand steps, count backward, count forward, count
every 10. confess, spend every morning trying find sunlight get sun eyes
set circadian rhythm, 100 jumping jacks. guy people
looking strange street. [Emily laughing] sometimes count every 10,
sometimes count backwards, sometimes count forward. indication
matters simply attach sort meaning increment
mode reaching increment? seem like something special
vision, maybe dive little bit is,


basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

basic level, broadly finally one set increments, matter
counting steps counting strokes, maybe every song, going
listen entire album. something don't know people anymore. [Emily
laughing] going listen whole playlist, listen again,
going run long playlist completed twice, can obviously see
getting at, know people going want implement tools.
guess nervous system somewhat indiscriminent comes
things, might also specificity. - think vision special,
think too, variety reasons. start, can really nerd
cool brain cool vision within brain. do,
start find things make vision unique, right? real estate,
neurological cortex real estate taken visual sense sense,
taste, touch, smell, right? Vision gets real estate, gets neurological
processing space sense, that? Well, evolution led us
prioritize visual experience. cool illusions maybe somebody's
mouth something different hearing, people sort create
weird tricks might go YouTube go viral, people trying figure
out, "What hear? see mouth doing?" comes
people prioritize see hearing two incompatible
kind sync. - Every time. - Yeah, every time, right? bet it, bet
looking rather seeing. that? Well,
[sighing] guess, couple things too, right? can see super far, can see
flickering candle horizon totally clear sky several miles away. can
see International Space Station floating night sky, right? Hundreds miles
away, eyes amazing. prioritize see, think
never, rarely [laughing] get experience visual experience
second guessed. Oftentimes, conversation maybe loud restaurant
know didn't hear person, right? say like, "Oh, say
that?" like, "Oh, thought said this," like, "No, didn't say that," right?
people will correct us ears get wrong, tasting something amazing
can't quite figure spices here, know tongue
isn't quite picking taste right way, read menu see
ingredients ask chef, like, "What put this? tastes
amazing." know tongue getting wrong, might touching


something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed

case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

something look tag see sort textile used really
amazing piece clothing looking buy. know sense touch
isn't quite getting right. rarely experience eyes get
updated, looking something, "Oh, think looking mom. Oh, no,
actually, actually husband." Okay, never happens, [laughing] right?
gotten vision wrong might get thing experiencing
sense. trust visual experience, sort naive
realism see reflects world way actually is, never really
fully tested, never get input feedback seen something wrong,
visual illusion pops social media, right? Like dress example, last
week so, horse-seal-lion drawing social media
too, "What see?" "I see horse," someone says, "I see seal," chaos
erupts, or, "I thought dress blue," "No, thought gold." don't remember
options 'cause see blue, so, [laughing] right? [Andrew laughing]
dividing families friendships seen something
person just literally cannot see. love examples pop
social media do, defies previous expectations.
interests you, really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor, plays
ideas too, installations just fascinating. saw one museum once,
walked long hall just big black rectangle painted
wall. like, "This guy's super famous, hell? just big black
rectangle painted wall. about, hoax? [laughing] museum
paid much, what?" whatever. get closer, get closer,
eyes start settle adapt different visual lighting, realize not
black square painted wall, huge hole carved wall,
whole world back behind can't see right away, eyes
adapt different lighting conditions. - Beautiful. - amazing, yeah. - vision
scientist, see, exhibit? - not right now,
retrospective several years ago done Sydney, work
place. - Great. - Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up, because, like dress
example, horse-seal-lion drawing, artists like Anish Kapoor's work,
moment gives us different unexpected insight world. challenges
us see something hadn't seen before, induces, tricks us seeing
something wouldn't otherwise seen. rare moments


think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

think actually really important understanding eyes normally do?
wouldn't find examples surprising, engaging, shocking,
routinely gotten experience realizing not seeing world way
is. think vision special, can thought tool
can add toolkit better accomplish goals. not saying
just focus imagining world attentional spotlight, maybe
something can employ strategically occasion think going
best help us, need extra little push cross literal metaphorical finish
line, doesn't tactic use, just like not bad use
vision boards, use something else also. not bad talk
encouraging ways, try adding another tool tool belt case not
enough get job done. think great power thinking
visual experience alongside tactics might use meeting goals.
another one tactics might like numerics talking about, "Do
think jumping jacks terms groups 10 set 100?"
routinely, might able set goal 100 sustain
number 60, number 70, maybe starting get harder, somebody
just starting wants able make 100, probably not going work,
quite challenging first time trying it.
instead, setting micro goals groups 10 going useful,
start get number eight nine, number 88 89, really getting hard,
need extra little hedonic hit pleasure accomplishment, micro dopamine rush
might get hitting another decade milestone, another group-of-10 milestone.
get little hit pleasure, excitement self-congratulations, might
enough sustain us next challenging physical obstacle, next group
10 might experience. isn't prescription give say,
"Every person decide 25 jumping jacks goal." No,
idiosyncratic introspect about, "Where goal, thing
trying accomplish?" set goals realistically, inspirationally well.
want set goal will challenge us, isn't impossible. don't want set goals
easy, not going trick feeling great
one jumping jack, okay? Great, pretty sure people, goal,
can one, going feel great hit goal? No,
easy, didn't doubt one, 25?


Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank

Okay, yeah, might feel pretty good that. Well, next group 25
now 50? goals might seem just beyond brink
possible, will feel good hit that, going give next sort
boost energy going need go little bit further, either time next
time. - Yeah, think vision special, again, strongly biased here. reason
initially learned work was, well, now amazing book,
time, wasn't book, just scientific papers,

00:57:12 Fit People View World Differently?, States Body & Visual
Experiences

course, upon book rests, papers really important,
relationship vision obviously sense space,
sense space time related. make idea quite simple
listening, narrow visual window, measuring, time bin also gets
smaller, right? makes sense hear it, whereas take huge
visual landscape, actually carving time differently. sort like moving
slow frame rate fine frame rate, slow-motion camera actually taking lot
snapshots, right? measuring distance time finely. so, whereas
strobe example, strobe low frequency, going
here, here, here, opposed slow motion, right? Strobe gives course view
time domain high-speed photography gives fine view time domain.
almost certain, without knowledge underlying data, knowledge
mechanism, almost certain, not certain, placing narrow visual
aperture, change way perceive time. Now, question,
honest, know answer advance, love tell us bit
works still reverse, meaning unfit people view world versus
fit people view world, unmotivated people visually see world, opposed
highly motivated people. talked elite runners, gave Michael
Phelps's example, maybe describe study, think particularly
important one, mostly because, yes, identifies perhaps physiological
psychological differences motivated unmotivated, fit unfit people,
also provides path remedy that. - Mm-hmm, yeah, lab, also
several labs, work looking relation states


body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank

body visual experiences. haven't necessarily tried integrate motivation
science element it, looking see visual experiences change
function different states body? looked people experience
chronic fatigue, elderly, people overweight, wearing heavy
backpacks, sort put experience overweight,
happens perceptions environment? Well, find distances
look overweight, chronically tired, older rather younger,
weighted extra baggage, distances look farther hills look steeper.
done studies too, try give people energy, deprive
energy, see change perception space.
sort classic technique double-blind study participant doesn't really
know experiencing. - thought going say, "A double espresso."
- Oh. [laughing] also good psychological experience give people. Yeah,
double-blind experiment participant doesn't really know full extent
experiencing, researcher interacting
also doesn't. lot medical studies, give somebody drug
give somebody placebo, sugar pill, importantly, nobody really knows
got analyzed data results revealed
people drug, active agent, idea psychological
research. case, give people Kool-Aid drink.
people, Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, actual caloric entity, give
energy. people drank Kool-Aid sweetened Splenda. So, yeah, sweet,
actually doesn't caloric value, not giving people energy, just
giving experience sweetness. Now, people, course, really good
identifying real sugar Splenda, put Kool-Aid,
pretty noxious powder, actually masked everybody nobody idea. -
'Cause tasted like garbage everybody. - tastes like garbage, yeah. [laughing] -
Sorry, Kool-Aid. mean, sure many people love Kool-Aid, guess
sales Kool-Aid will reveal data. - [laughing] Yeah, grew Nebraska actually,
Kool-Aid from, originated Nebraska. - Oh. - feel like betraying
roots slightly casting shade Kool-Aid, worked,
asked guess got, tested afterwards wrong.
nobody's able guess accuracy, "What drink sweetened with?"
important blind, way scientists use it, didn't know


drinking. give 10 15 minutes sugar
metabolize, measured circulating blood glucose levels make sure
had, fact, given body circulating glucose, energy might use next
activity. researcher, again, didn't know whether just served sugar
Splenda, asked people estimate distance. gave people
energy, kept others sort whatever normal level was, found
people didn't even know given energy
drinking Kool-Aid sweetened sugar, perceived space constricted,
visual illusion proximity induced, felt finish line, again,
context exercise task, closer them. just way
physiology labs, vision science, physiology labs, found people chronically
tired, don't feel like much energy, physically weighted
moving within environment costly, create
experience people. experimental version that,
energy, world looks easier, distances finish line don't look far.
experimental evidence show people's states
body impact visual experience. Now, motivation researcher, me,
big question is, well, point study then, besides just showing
connection body eyes visual experience? think
fundamental one reasons people experience difficulty
exercising, really harder body, physical state, move
within space, might say like, "Well, don't just go exercise?"
world looks harder them, distance supposed walk
doctor tells to, partner encourages to, hill
hike someone told good health, looks
challenging somebody better physical health. Now,
looks way, looks harder, feels like might harder,
psychologically, know is. set up, psychologically,
mentally, kind failure experience, like, "I don't know resources
get job, looks really hard," already motivationally place task
closer impossible you. put together then, know
people whose bodies might make challenging exercise seeing
world challenging way downstream motivational
psychological effects makes less likely try take task first


place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,
wonderful resource,

can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
university book, will point people provide link to,

place experience harder people do. - solution
same, however? Meaning, people taught adjust visual goal line
set visual spotlight intermediate goal, can overcome challenge
face simply virtue skewed perception? - Yes, studies
done, looking connection narrowed focus attention
improvements exercise, not find works people
shape backfires people shape, works everybody.
strategy everybody can adopt, just simply like, "What
allocate attentional resources to? sort ignore, focus
on?" visually induces kind illusion everybody, regardless
whether overweight, target weight, struggling get
there, already accomplished want be,

01:05:54 Caffeine, Stimulants, Visual Windows & Motivation

visual illusion can induced everybody kinds
consequences. - Terrific, earlier made joke double espresso, now make
serious statement double espresso, contains caffeine
caffeine stimulant, like stimulants, cause change visual world.
salient one one police officers look for, parents suspecting
kids ingested substances kind look for, somebody's pupils
unusually large given visual environment, indication high levels
autonomic arousal. street drug translation this, people take amphetamine
cocaine will big pupils. People relaxed small pupils.
However, everyone know pupil size also dynamically regulated
bright visual environment, multiple things controlling pupil size. However,
know stressed aroused way, positive
negative, pupils get big, within visual system, equates
narrowing visual aperture. rather ingesting sugar, guessing
world, certainly US needs ingest less sugar, least
hearing. sure sugar sucro-nistas there, sucrose-anistas. [Emily
laughing] will also come pitchforks, face it, people will
probably better off ingesting less simple sugar, caffeine great motivator
internal sense arousal, also narrows visual window.


imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,

cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching

imagine using healthy amounts caffeine combined maybe even blinders
sort horses wear, maybe like hoodie hat. [Emily laughing] Maybe even
blinders order get challenging milestones.
evidence people without, well, obviously people without
knowledge works, studies looking adrenaline,
epinephrine, stimulants impact motivation? - don't know, honestly, yeah. -
[Andrew] energy drinks big thing now. - Yeah, yeah, sure, are,
actually physiologically aroused, jazzed, whatever, amped up,
just think are, studies, found work way,
can produce kinds consequences. like tells us can
actually change state body induce kinds experiences, can
just think that, [laughing] can trick yourself, can placebo effect
produce kinds effects. give coffee like 12 years ago, not
any. - sorry. - love taste, [laughing] decaf jam, can't drink
caffeine, didn't actually thing many people,
like make feel energized awake, just got sweaty jittery
anxious couldn't focus. - Yeah, people already fairly high
baseline level attention motivation, find puts autonomic seesaw
far sympathetic tone. - Yeah. - Yeah. - happened marry kind
person, also can't drink caffeine, loves taste coffee. interesting thing
coffee morning feel like ready go day.
just part routine [laughing] whatever, taste
sensation feel like ready take day, even though, mean, yeah, decaf still
caffeine it, not drinking much probably actually create
caffeinated experience body, tricking psychologically
thing that, years past, used work us both. think something
keep mind, like might hoodie can wear induce visual
illusion, can take advantage power mind. end day,
psychologist, believe non-zero power mind
doing, thinking about, allocate attention to, can
kind thing hoodie might cup caffeine might do. - Mm-hmm,
completely agree, visual aperture conscious control. amazing
feature visual system, can narrow expand it. Takes little bit practice,
think, people learn without moving head around expand


visual aperture narrow it, always tell people is, "Just imagine
really troubling text message really exciting text message coming in, sudden,
forget world around you."

01:10:13 Tools: Goal Setting & Cognitive (Non-Physical) Goals, Data Collection

can triggered outside events can learn anchor
visual attention. love ask kinds goals, meaning non-physical goals,
many people trying read more, hope, learn music,
language, things really involve cognitive goal lines internal goal lines. Reading
one chapter book night tangible goal, often
wondered systems allow highlight individual lines even
words page, visual obviously, everything else ruled except
word, always wished books naturally highlight page.
say that, someone will put comments, probably existed 10 years.
[Emily laughing] just showing Luddite am, example
tactic people use better approach cognitive goals, school, work,
recreational too, don't exist kind fitness sports domain? - Totally,
yeah, just shout brother-in-law, done research,
highlight different parts words paragraphs, found
effective way English-as-a-second-language learners pick up, is,
tying vision process learning language effective. whole
cool body work researchers looking that, right that. -
want mention does, place people can learn that?
can provide links if. - Yeah, let me. Yeah, yeah. [laughing] - Okay, will provide
links resources, 'cause want resources. - Yeah, yeah. - trying
learn second language long time. - Yeah, cool. - speak Spanish pretty weakly,
love get better it. - Oh, yeah. - Okay, approach later that. -
five-year-old son speaks Spanish better point, yeah. [laughing] -
clearly, better too, thank you. [laughing] - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
thinking too, started work within context exercise, course,
not people's goal life, isn't mine either, interests
outside improving exercise game. couple years ago, writing
book, also child, month opportunity pull


research together month son came be. started realize
became lot less interesting around, fascinating,
changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt
awful, just felt like, "I not making progress here," lot things
actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.

tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed

actually pressing, right? Like kid need get fed, go
day job, editor asking next draft book, going take
precedence, like many people, things command bandwidth, even
goal committed got books.
just felt looming anxiety goal require, didn't
daily practice, can't cram kind goal, take committed investment
sustained period time. looming anxiety not making


good enough progress, relying memory brain
recall, like, "How many times practice? like last time
practiced? like tried play bit riff like two weeks ago,
gotten better since then?" just felt like, "No, haven't practiced
enough. don't remember last time played was, definitely doesn't feel
like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank

research together month son came be. started realize

changing diapers feeding it. People come over, like,
"What's up? been? Tell something going life,"
talk boring? just felt like, "I've lost myself," used
pride crazy adventures problems get great
storyteller, that, sudden, disappeared soon came world,
became world. started thinking, like, "I need pull back
coolness, ever first place, need cooler person
coming across right now," decided, "I want learn play drums, want
one-hit wonder rockstar drummer. want one song, 'cause know not going
able that." not coordinated all, beginning time,
fifth grade, really vivid flash bulb memory playing basketball
first time, lost footing, knocked teammate, pushed bounds
ball, lost game not invited back [laughing]
team next season. fomented self-definition uncoordinated.
musician, not drummer, idea coordinating four limbs real time
like, "If that, proud." goal set myself,
time son came world, also trying think
goal setting improve ability ability get job done
faced pretty big obstacles. got practice techniques
talking see myself, tell people, "Hey, try thing,
narrowed focus attention, help something like becoming better
drummer?" answer yeah, tactics least work me, sometimes,
circumstances, people try goals
aren't necessarily exercise. One found particularly helpful overcoming
bad memory, everybody's memories faulty, right? Everybody sort
warped perception past, might skewed positively maybe
deserve, might skewed negatively feel looms large
mind, reflect something past, mistakes made,
social faux pas had, challenges faced work got
trouble boss colleague, really stands mind,
good side possibilities, probably aren't getting world right.
something brain evolved, give us faulty memory, level


sharpen, not encode remember able recall everything
experienced accuracy precision. problem comes
assessing goal progress. want accountant try
determine, "How doing? want become drummer, track getting
X, time runs out? going make not?" think
experience, whether want drummer not, lot people can
resonate with, trying determine, "Is trajectory, rate progress going
get job done X amount time? Will swimsuit body summer?" Or,
"Will save enough retirement time hit 65?" goals time
involved deadline, take moments assess trajectory.
just rely memory, probably going bad job assessing
trajectory, knowing whether pace meeting deadline. found
case thinking about, "Am actually going able learn song?
mean, know going lot slower probably anybody else,
give deadline commitment." decided going put show,
going invite everybody knew also people didn't know, going play
one song them, so. - writing book just child. -
Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - read book, see story, real
truth it. mean, play show fine. then, wrote
book, opportunities play publicly come up. like,
"All right, told people can play drums, better show actually still can play
song." - [Andrew] love it. - Yeah, fun. become one-hit
wonder, ask play song, like, "Encore," just going get
song second time, literally one-hit wonder. process figuring out, "Am
going able play show? sent invitations, date committed, people
coming listen one song, God bless them, going go?" felt

like getting better." thought, "You know what? stop relying
brain tell me, upward slope here? need look
data." love data, scientists love data, started collect data myself.
download app friend told called Reporter App,
lots kinds things there. Basically, just sets phone randomly
ping whatever questions want phone ask. records answers,
can download data, can make pretty graphs see, "What's change
answered questions time?" month, month,
phone ask couple times day, well, maybe twice day really, "Did
practice, since last time asked you," phone says, "did practice?" Mostly
no, yes, funnel couple questions, like, "How do,
feel? Check couple different emotion words now experience
played." month, month, went office,
downloaded data, first took stock looked numbers, like, "How
think last month?" thought, "Same every month, didn't
really get anywhere. Yeah, practiced, still feel awful." cried, cried
practice. upset setting goal feeling anxious it.
remember cried, cried much personal conquest wouldn't
matter anybody else. Honestly, really doesn't matter scope things anyway,
not going become drummer professionally, cares embarrass
publicly? found data memory totally wrong, actually
practiced far times remembered, looked emotion
words used, clear upward trajectory. Yeah, cry, part hadn't
misremembered made up, end month, gotten compliment
husband, actually drummer, said like, "Hey, wasn't bad."
one expletive, "You effing amazing [laughing] one thing
practicing at." like, "Okay, fine, husband, right, just?"
moment, didn't really feel great, downplayed it, result, didn't
stick brain, right? remember stupid felt cried can't make


progress, downplayed mind thing actually should've
legitimate indicator progress made. say, needed
collect data look objectively, accurately completely,
brain wasn't me. visual experience [laughing]
downloading data looking actual experience gave better
insight trying assess trajectory progress, became accurate
accountant progress, important setting goals resetting
need calibrate light left much time
in? - love it, basically, understand correctly, intermediate goals
say daily practice, twice-a-day practice, reading, math, et cetera, not visual
goal line, really help visualize aspect related non-visual goal line,
case, Reporter App useful tool. never heard it, plan use it,
sure number people will interested it, sounds like others there,

01:21:54 Year Review & Memory

one found useful? - Yeah, yeah, another one
even visual that, [laughing] Reporter App, although visual
components really effective like data want collect numbers
experience, another one called 1 Second Everyday app.
really awesome app mechanism record one second life.
awesome community people just live love
experiences, creator got chance talk with, done
this, taken one-second video aspect life, every day, for, don't
know, 12 years, 13 years something. - One second? - Yeah, one second.
app smash 'em together give chronology year,
month, last decade life like, presents like
streamlined video you. just see flashes life however long
tell app create montage you. see videos
people made, especially really long time,
fascinating. too, tried it, one second today's drumming
performance, another second, not enough capture, "Am actually good job
drumming?" or, "What's trajectory drumming?" guy made says
one awesome one-second videos ever made brick wall.


like, "Well, didn't need video that, wall doing?" not crumbling,
not earthquake land something like that, just slightly jittery, one second
brick wall. like, "How motivating exciting you, that?
13 years every day, one second, one second
matters most?" says, "Because comes montage,
reminds really horrific moment family. first wall saw
walked room heard sister-in-law awful, awful
experience, intestines started twist knot up,
brink death. just found out, just gotten
hospital, diagnosed issue required immediate surgery. family
hear this, stunned might die, like, 'Right now,
might die.' first thing saw, reminds precious life is,
important family rest whatever day didn't
matter, needed together right now."
emotion purpose life conjured reminded looks one second
brick wall pops video feed. visually oriented want
ways remember, "What life like, year review, look
like?" awesome app, 1 second Everyday, can help that. -
great recommendations. couple reflections, first all, brick wall example
beautiful way highlighting feature visual system,
brain largely thinks symbols, efficient, batches entire experiences
symbols, case, brick wall can attached whole set experiences
meaningful individual, brick walls don't mean that, didn't mean
hearing this. think highlights fact actual symbol
less relevant attach symbol, symbols efficient
even one-second view something, can attach it, better worse.
absolute, almost rabid proponent people getting morning sunlight
eyes fundamental layer setting circadian rhythms sleep
health zero-cost practice, believe not, can done time year,
anywhere. [Emily laughing] take little bit effort, get outside,
can't window windshield efficient, huge
outsize effects human health, now demonstrated
again. going just sort call action, people aren't already
this, going start using 1 Second app record morning sunlight viewing,


prove even cloud cover, getting photons
indoors worthwhile. also love next dog, go
puppy full-size dog, maybe even end, knows? Great,
wonderful tools, given us huge number practical tools, which, frankly, isn't
always case podcasts. always strive science science-based
tools kind mantra,

01:26:32 Visual Tools & Mental Health, Depression & Visual Priming

given rich set tools apply. just want briefly backtrack
something, final question. Earlier, talking unfit people see
world challenging, maybe even hills steeper, distances further,
shifting people state energy, either cognitively ingestion
real glucose get energetic lift, maybe caffeine within
practice span healthy behaviors, that. many people
suffering depression, one key features depression lack
energy, even though can anxiety associated depression,
wonder whether not tools deployed will deployed
context mental health, depression vicious loop, right? People feel
lack energy hopelessness, things just look harder, just
verifies negative worldview downward spiral. medication,
cases, social sport, et cetera, can helpful, feel
energized, side effects, often, problem, however. efforts
implement visual tools create increase systolic blood pressure
kind readiness willingness lean people perceive immense
challenge? not, anyone listening, know lot listeners
mental health space helping space, speak, can imagine zero
cost, right? provide, people sighted, apparati it.
aware studies like laboratory involved studies? 'Cause
just see immense value implementing sorts tools developed. -
Yeah, haven't explored ideas directly. call scientists
there, great opportunity start looking tools within mental health
space, right. researchers though have, not use inducing narrowed
attentional focus can now feel energized go run?


looked relationship anxiety, depression visual experience,
found, decades, evidence people depression anxiety,
attention captured within bigger global surrounding world things
negative reinforcing worldview. Now, happens everybody,
things mind tend pop out, [laughing] whatever thinking
about, might start seeing version showing world around us
captures attention. idea called priming, thinking might
lead us attend world, see things way aligns
already thinking about, just thinking
depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts, cognitively
accessible, going mind, also captures
visual gaze. think like, "The world hard, world full sadness,"
thought mind, start seeing people frowns
faces experiencing anxiety, captures attention, even
people around might not seeing world experiencing
world way, becomes reinforcing. think world threatening,
notice threats around me, confirms thinking,
heightens anxiety fear, leads narrowly focus
elements environment aligned worldview, really hard get
that, vicious cycle can come from. really well
established within medical community, selective attention relating states
mental unwellness, pretty well established.
interventions done people depression anxiety, saying like, "Here's
array, photograph bunch different faces. Yes, artificial, kind looks like
page yearbook, high school yearbook, look faces smiling,
look faces smiling. Try right now, spend 10 minutes eyes
focus look people," effective intervention improving
[sighing] people's sense self-efficacy, of, "What can accomplish next?" feel
little bit energized. doesn't cure depression, doesn't cure anxiety. mean,
literal physical afflictions have, not quick fix, can produce
temporary change might way start getting rut. - Mm-hmm, yeah,
think nowadays increasing attention tools will help people orient
start veer towards suicidal depression, veer back depressive
episode, anxiety episode. mean, trying reverse entire syndrome set


syndromes far complicated. Likewise, health space, just trying get
people deploy realtime tools

01:31:33 Focusing Attention & Increasing Visual Detail/Resolution

adjust anxiety exercise often on. kind final, also
kind high-level question, imagining that, plan use visual goal setting
spotlighting, using actually time runs, works really well.
Yesterday, took run near waterfront here, think somewhat incorrectly,
entire run, thinking getting back statue, started. -
[laughing] Yeah. - find ran fastest final 20 meters. - Cool. - Which,
admittedly, wasn't fast all, faster preceded it. [Emily laughing]
works makes perfect sense works. done studies
exploring features vision, like luminosity, bright something
people perceive it. completely different context,
kind higher level, kind black belt version talking here,
not focusing specific visual location intermediate long-
term goal, using app ask question tap feeling, create
visual representation motivational state, also making phone
bright possible, also trying take visual window actually pay attention
details location? simply matter kind of, geek speak,
visual neuroscience, just call like low spatial frequency, just sort
grabbing black white snapshot something mind? attach
detail effort specific thing focused on, evidence
effective? - certainly changes brains doing, [laughing]
define effectiveness? question philosophers scientists will
always debate. - Will keep running? - Yeah. [laughing] [Andrew laughing] will
use towards end run, just like picked on. Yeah,
cool studies neuroscientists, not I, not coming lab,
neuroscientists done looking at, "What brain
decided going focus attention element world not pay
attention something else? just sort tricking thoughts
something different, something basic, low level?" answer yes,
area brain, fusiform face area, part brain really


specialized making sense faces. important social species pay attention
people, pay attention faces, trying communicate
face, brain developed really specialized central area
then. neuroscientists will present face somebody, superimposed
house something else less special [laughing] us social
human species. things, sort like images
sort transparent, overlaid one another, eyes getting images
brain getting images in, can will focus
house. "Just really pay attention features house, even though everything
face still too," or, "Pay attention face just tell me,
deciding want hold to, want look right now?"
can see brain responding that, people saying like,
"I'm really seeing face, details face, 'cause paying attention
face," even though know eyes also looking engaged
contents house right there, smacked top, fusiform face area lights up.
saying like, "Nah, really focused house now," see
activation fusiform face area decline areas brain's neurological
real estate start engage. yeah, think something it, that, high level,
brains responding psychology well. great power
really, intention, practice, decide, "How want engage world?"
can produce real change bodies way experience
world? answer yes. - Fantastic, well, given us ton mechanistic
conceptual practical information, speaking lot people say thank
taking time schedule, amidst kids running lab teaching
