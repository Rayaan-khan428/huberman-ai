Again, drinklmnt, L-M-N-T, .com/huberman claim free sample pack. Okay,
talk light. First, want talk physics light, promise make
clear, even don't background physics. want talk


biology light, meaning light converted signals brain body
can use impact things like organ health disease, can use light order
repair particular organs, like skin, eyes, brain, et cetera. physics
light can made simple just illustrating key bullet points. first bullet
point light electromagnetic energy. word electromagnetic feels daunting
you, well, just discard just think light energy think energy
something can impact things environment. Now, way imagine light
conceptualize light energy around light traveling little
wavelengths. reason, watching, making little
wavey motion hand actually way light energy moves little
waves. Just like sound waves coming impinging ears, can
hear talking right now, happening, sound waves, meaning
movement air particles impacting ear drum. Well, light energy just
little bits electromagnetic energy traveling environment time
little waves impinging brain body eyes, et cetera.
mentioned before, energy can change way things behave. can cause
reactions cells body. can cause reactions fruit, instance, right? see
piece fruit not ripe, gets lot sunlight ripens.
electromagnetic energy sunlight impact plant tree, even
fruit directly. parallel example energy ability impact things,
familiar food fact food calories. Calorie measure
energy. everything much heat generated burn
particular article food, believe not. turns hot given article
food burns gives sense much energy can provide body terms
body's ability store use energy. again, think light electromagnetic
energy,

00:12:23 Wavelengths Light

really put word energy capital letters, embed mind, going
forward, understand first bullet point light terms
physics light. Now, second thing need understand physics
light light many different wavelengths, simplest way conceptualize
imagine cover Pink Floyd album, prism.


white beam light going prism. prism splits beam light
looks like rainbow. got reds, orange, greens, blues,
purples, et cetera. Anytime light environment, so-called white
light. includes wavelengths, sunlight forms light also
wavelengths light can't see. think rainbow,
just visible spectrum light. also wavelengths light not visible
us, visible animals, can still impact brain
body still energy wavelengths. give examples this.
Humans not species can see infrared realm spectrum. pit

burn skin. learn today's episode, ultraviolet light can also positively
impact us. fact, will describe particular set new results show ultraviolet
light viewed just minutes day, landing skin just minutes
day, can actually offset lot pain. actually ability reduce amount
pain sensed body. now understand specific circuits brain
body allow happen. talk related protocols little bit
later. important thing understand physics light
energy different wavelengths. see wavelengths,
basically say light impacts us many different levels. so-called
levels referring different wavelengths light. welcome
think different wavelengths light different colors, understand
truly colors light

00:15:38 Light Penetrates Tissues



can't see, yet powerful impact brain body. Now,
third bullet point understand physics light different wavelengths
light, way wave travels, can penetrate tissues different
depths. very, important. Today, going talk lot red light
therapies near-infrared light therapies. called longer wavelengths.
Longer wavelengths, just think bigger, longer wave, right? bigger curve,
opposed short wavelength light, going shorter, right? short
wavelength light something like blue green light ultraviolet light. Blue,
green, ultraviolet light, shortwave length light, doesn't tend penetrate
tissues easily. way physics light interacts
physical properties skin tissues body. basically,
shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone
marrow. many people, will hard conceptualize. think, "Well, wait,
got skin there. Doesn't light just bounce off?" answer no,
way long wavelength light interacts absorbance properties
skin. Absorbance properties just way skin takes light energy
converts different form energy. skin not able take long
wavelength light, like red light near-infrared light, absorb it. tissues
deeper body can. shine red light near-infrared light onto surface
skin, see red glow reflectance surface skin.
lot photon energy, light energy longer wavelengths indeed
passing top layers skin, deeper layers skin, can even
make deep layers arm. start transition physics
light biological impacts light, just understanding different wavelengths
light impact tissues different levels, literally different depths, will help better
understand light different colors, different intensities long
exposed colors intensities light can change way cells


organs body work. didn't sound weird enough can pass light
particular tissues land absorbed tissues deeper
body, well, turns different wavelengths light also best absorbed
particular so-called organelles within cells. organelles? Organelles
different compartments different functions within given cell. instance,
mitochondria, responsible generating ATP energy cells,
exist particular depth, particular location within cell. not cell
surface. sit somewhat deeper cell. nucleus individual cells
contains DNA, sits particular depth location within cell. Different
wavelengths light not can penetrate different tissues different
cells body, can also penetrate access particular organelles,
meaning mitochondria nucleus different aspects cells
responsible different functions. exquisitely important, exquisitely
powerful learn today, particular wavelengths light can used
stimulate function particular organelles within particular cells, within particular
organs body. can think no form energy, not sound, not chemical
energy, not drugs, not food, not touch, no form energy can target particular
locations cells, organelles, organs body, extent
light can. words, imagine real world surgical tool

00:20:13 Light & Body: Direct & Indirect Signals

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table
surface. absorbance properties given surface will determine whether not
light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go

impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call

called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course

bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light

nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin

established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards

continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,

getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure

think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

Again, drinklmnt, L-M-N-T, .com/huberman claim free sample pack. Okay,
talk light. First, want talk physics light, promise make
clear, even don't background physics. want talk


biology light, meaning light converted signals brain body
can use impact things like organ health disease, can use light order
repair particular organs, like skin, eyes, brain, et cetera. physics
light can made simple just illustrating key bullet points. first bullet
point light electromagnetic energy. word electromagnetic feels daunting
you, well, just discard just think light energy think energy
something can impact things environment. Now, way imagine light
conceptualize light energy around light traveling little
wavelengths. reason, watching, making little
wavey motion hand actually way light energy moves little
waves. Just like sound waves coming impinging ears, can
hear talking right now, happening, sound waves, meaning
movement air particles impacting ear drum. Well, light energy just
little bits electromagnetic energy traveling environment time
little waves impinging brain body eyes, et cetera.
mentioned before, energy can change way things behave. can cause
reactions cells body. can cause reactions fruit, instance, right? see
piece fruit not ripe, gets lot sunlight ripens.
electromagnetic energy sunlight impact plant tree, even
fruit directly. parallel example energy ability impact things,
familiar food fact food calories. Calorie measure
energy. everything much heat generated burn
particular article food, believe not. turns hot given article
food burns gives sense much energy can provide body terms
body's ability store use energy. again, think light electromagnetic
energy,

00:12:23 Wavelengths Light

really put word energy capital letters, embed mind, going
forward, understand first bullet point light terms
physics light. Now, second thing need understand physics
light light many different wavelengths, simplest way conceptualize
imagine cover Pink Floyd album, prism.


white beam light going prism. prism splits beam light
looks like rainbow. got reds, orange, greens, blues,
purples, et cetera. Anytime light environment, so-called white
light. includes wavelengths, sunlight forms light also
wavelengths light can't see. think rainbow,
just visible spectrum light. also wavelengths light not visible
us, visible animals, can still impact brain
body still energy wavelengths. give examples this.
Humans not species can see infrared realm spectrum. pit
viper, meaning snake infrared sensors, however, can sense infrared.
walk jungle pit viper there, sees cloud
heat emission body emitting infrared energy time.
casting off infrared energy. snake can see it, can't. put
particular set goggles infrared goggles, well, able see
heat emissions organism, human otherwise, emit infrared
energy. take opposite end spectrum. familiar seeing things
blue green pale blue. say that, meaning even shorter
wavelength light there. Ultraviolet light really good example light energy
coming sun environment reflected off surfaces
time. don't see it. yet, bright outside, ultraviolet light can
burn skin. learn today's episode, ultraviolet light can also positively
impact us. fact, will describe particular set new results show ultraviolet
light viewed just minutes day, landing skin just minutes
day, can actually offset lot pain. actually ability reduce amount
pain sensed body. now understand specific circuits brain
body allow happen. talk related protocols little bit
later. important thing understand physics light
energy different wavelengths. see wavelengths,
basically say light impacts us many different levels. so-called
levels referring different wavelengths light. welcome
think different wavelengths light different colors, understand
truly colors light

00:15:38 Light Penetrates Tissues



can't see, yet powerful impact brain body. Now,
third bullet point understand physics light different wavelengths
light, way wave travels, can penetrate tissues different
depths. very, important. Today, going talk lot red light
therapies near-infrared light therapies. called longer wavelengths.
Longer wavelengths, just think bigger, longer wave, right? bigger curve,
opposed short wavelength light, going shorter, right? short
wavelength light something like blue green light ultraviolet light. Blue,
green, ultraviolet light, shortwave length light, doesn't tend penetrate
tissues easily. way physics light interacts
physical properties skin tissues body. basically,
shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone
marrow. many people, will hard conceptualize. think, "Well, wait,
got skin there. Doesn't light just bounce off?" answer no,
way long wavelength light interacts absorbance properties
skin. Absorbance properties just way skin takes light energy
converts different form energy. skin not able take long
wavelength light, like red light near-infrared light, absorb it. tissues
deeper body can. shine red light near-infrared light onto surface
skin, see red glow reflectance surface skin.
lot photon energy, light energy longer wavelengths indeed
passing top layers skin, deeper layers skin, can even
make deep layers arm. start transition physics
light biological impacts light, just understanding different wavelengths
light impact tissues different levels, literally different depths, will help better
understand light different colors, different intensities long
exposed colors intensities light can change way cells


organs body work. didn't sound weird enough can pass light
particular tissues land absorbed tissues deeper
body, well, turns different wavelengths light also best absorbed
particular so-called organelles within cells. organelles? Organelles
different compartments different functions within given cell. instance,
mitochondria, responsible generating ATP energy cells,
exist particular depth, particular location within cell. not cell
surface. sit somewhat deeper cell. nucleus individual cells
contains DNA, sits particular depth location within cell. Different
wavelengths light not can penetrate different tissues different
cells body, can also penetrate access particular organelles,
meaning mitochondria nucleus different aspects cells
responsible different functions. exquisitely important, exquisitely
powerful learn today, particular wavelengths light can used
stimulate function particular organelles within particular cells, within particular
organs body. can think no form energy, not sound, not chemical
energy, not drugs, not food, not touch, no form energy can target particular
locations cells, organelles, organs body, extent
light can. words, imagine real world surgical tool
modulate biology,

00:20:13 Light & Body: Direct & Indirect Signals

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table
surface. absorbance properties given surface will determine whether not
light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go
episode vision. photoreceptors back eye, absorbing light
different wavelengths, rods, cones. place, course, light can
impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call
pigment melanin. within skin multiple cell types, top layer skin,


called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course
wide variation degree pigmentation skin,
genetics, also born raised, much light
exposure throughout year, right? people toward equator tend
melanocyte activity people located North Pole.
course, people live different locations throughout Earth, regardless genetic
background born. so, know, light exposure,
melanocytes will turn genetic programs biological programs lead
enhanced pigmentation skin, call tanning. way
absorbing UV light specifically. melanocytes, specific example
pigment absorbs light particular length, case, ultraviolet shortwave
length light, turn creates set biological signals within cells turn
creates changes skin pigmentation. photoreceptors,
melanocytes. third example like provide every cell body.
mean every cell body, meaning cell part
bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell
type, informs another cell type, relays signal kind bucket
brigade manner off spleen says spleen, "Hey, lot UV light
here. actually stress. fact, much UV light need
activate immune program protect skin." response that, spleen can
deploy certain signals certain cell types go start repairing skin


damaged UV light. direct signals indirect signals,
every case, starts light particular wavelengths absorbed particular
pigments properties surfaces light waves land on. recall
discussion physics light, remember, not just light
impinging surface body. Light can actually penetrate deep skin
access least certain tissues cells body. Even though can't see
wavelengths light, getting time. perhaps best way
wrap discussion physics biology light bit bow
think light transducer, meaning communicator going
environment around signals arriving surface
impacting surface body. many signals taken cells

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time

seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless

getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock

tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way

collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant

progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler

melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free

used long time, can basically point phone particular light

readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light

talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger

can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,

Again, drinklmnt, L-M-N-T, .com/huberman claim free sample pack. Okay,
talk light. First, want talk physics light, promise make
clear, even don't background physics. want talk


biology light, meaning light converted signals brain body
can use impact things like organ health disease, can use light order
repair particular organs, like skin, eyes, brain, et cetera. physics
light can made simple just illustrating key bullet points. first bullet
point light electromagnetic energy. word electromagnetic feels daunting
you, well, just discard just think light energy think energy
something can impact things environment. Now, way imagine light
conceptualize light energy around light traveling little
wavelengths. reason, watching, making little
wavey motion hand actually way light energy moves little
waves. Just like sound waves coming impinging ears, can
hear talking right now, happening, sound waves, meaning
movement air particles impacting ear drum. Well, light energy just
little bits electromagnetic energy traveling environment time
little waves impinging brain body eyes, et cetera.
mentioned before, energy can change way things behave. can cause
reactions cells body. can cause reactions fruit, instance, right? see
piece fruit not ripe, gets lot sunlight ripens.
electromagnetic energy sunlight impact plant tree, even
fruit directly. parallel example energy ability impact things,
familiar food fact food calories. Calorie measure
energy. everything much heat generated burn
particular article food, believe not. turns hot given article
food burns gives sense much energy can provide body terms
body's ability store use energy. again, think light electromagnetic
energy,

00:12:23 Wavelengths Light

really put word energy capital letters, embed mind, going
forward, understand first bullet point light terms
physics light. Now, second thing need understand physics
light light many different wavelengths, simplest way conceptualize
imagine cover Pink Floyd album, prism.


white beam light going prism. prism splits beam light
looks like rainbow. got reds, orange, greens, blues,
purples, et cetera. Anytime light environment, so-called white
light. includes wavelengths, sunlight forms light also
wavelengths light can't see. think rainbow,
just visible spectrum light. also wavelengths light not visible
us, visible animals, can still impact brain
body still energy wavelengths. give examples this.
Humans not species can see infrared realm spectrum. pit
viper, meaning snake infrared sensors, however, can sense infrared.
walk jungle pit viper there, sees cloud

casting off infrared energy. snake can see it, can't. put
particular set goggles infrared goggles, well, able see
heat emissions organism, human otherwise, emit infrared
energy. take opposite end spectrum. familiar seeing things
blue green pale blue. say that, meaning even shorter
wavelength light there. Ultraviolet light really good example light energy
coming sun environment reflected off surfaces
time. don't see it. yet, bright outside, ultraviolet light can
burn skin. learn today's episode, ultraviolet light can also positively
impact us. fact, will describe particular set new results show ultraviolet
light viewed just minutes day, landing skin just minutes
day, can actually offset lot pain. actually ability reduce amount
pain sensed body. now understand specific circuits brain
body allow happen. talk related protocols little bit
later. important thing understand physics light
energy different wavelengths. see wavelengths,
basically say light impacts us many different levels. so-called
levels referring different wavelengths light. welcome
think different wavelengths light different colors, understand
truly colors light

00:15:38 Light Penetrates Tissues



can't see, yet powerful impact brain body. Now,
third bullet point understand physics light different wavelengths
light, way wave travels, can penetrate tissues different
depths. very, important. Today, going talk lot red light
therapies near-infrared light therapies. called longer wavelengths.
Longer wavelengths, just think bigger, longer wave, right? bigger curve,
opposed short wavelength light, going shorter, right? short
wavelength light something like blue green light ultraviolet light. Blue,
green, ultraviolet light, shortwave length light, doesn't tend penetrate
tissues easily. way physics light interacts
physical properties skin tissues body. basically,
shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone
marrow. many people, will hard conceptualize. think, "Well, wait,
got skin there. Doesn't light just bounce off?" answer no,
way long wavelength light interacts absorbance properties
skin. Absorbance properties just way skin takes light energy
converts different form energy. skin not able take long
wavelength light, like red light near-infrared light, absorb it. tissues
deeper body can. shine red light near-infrared light onto surface
skin, see red glow reflectance surface skin.
lot photon energy, light energy longer wavelengths indeed
passing top layers skin, deeper layers skin, can even
make deep layers arm. start transition physics
light biological impacts light, just understanding different wavelengths
light impact tissues different levels, literally different depths, will help better
understand light different colors, different intensities long
exposed colors intensities light can change way cells


organs body work. didn't sound weird enough can pass light
particular tissues land absorbed tissues deeper
body, well, turns different wavelengths light also best absorbed
particular so-called organelles within cells. organelles? Organelles
different compartments different functions within given cell. instance,
mitochondria, responsible generating ATP energy cells,
exist particular depth, particular location within cell. not cell
surface. sit somewhat deeper cell. nucleus individual cells
contains DNA, sits particular depth location within cell. Different
wavelengths light not can penetrate different tissues different
cells body, can also penetrate access particular organelles,
meaning mitochondria nucleus different aspects cells
responsible different functions. exquisitely important, exquisitely
powerful learn today, particular wavelengths light can used
stimulate function particular organelles within particular cells, within particular
organs body. can think no form energy, not sound, not chemical
energy, not drugs, not food, not touch, no form energy can target particular
locations cells, organelles, organs body, extent
light can. words, imagine real world surgical tool
modulate biology,

00:20:13 Light & Body: Direct & Indirect Signals

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table
surface. absorbance properties given surface will determine whether not
light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go
episode vision. photoreceptors back eye, absorbing light
different wavelengths, rods, cones. place, course, light can
impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call
pigment melanin. within skin multiple cell types, top layer skin,


called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course
wide variation degree pigmentation skin,
genetics, also born raised, much light

melanocyte activity people located North Pole.
course, people live different locations throughout Earth, regardless genetic

melanocytes will turn genetic programs biological programs lead
enhanced pigmentation skin, call tanning. way
absorbing UV light specifically. melanocytes, specific example
pigment absorbs light particular length, case, ultraviolet shortwave
length light, turn creates set biological signals within cells turn
creates changes skin pigmentation. photoreceptors,
melanocytes. third example like provide every cell body.
mean every cell body, meaning cell part
bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell
type, informs another cell type, relays signal kind bucket
brigade manner off spleen says spleen, "Hey, lot UV light
here. actually stress. fact, much UV light need
activate immune program protect skin." response that, spleen can
deploy certain signals certain cell types go start repairing skin

every case, starts light particular wavelengths absorbed particular

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects

also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can

known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking

00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure
eyes face skin throughout day, provided not
getting sunburnt. actually healthy thing mood energy throughout
day. night, basically hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
even tiny bit UVB exposure artificial sources can mess us terms

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people
receive dose UVB light exposure 20 30 minutes outdoors.
people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses. people wore sleeveless
shirts. encouraged people wear shorts. indeed wearing clothing.
not naked. wearing clothing culturally
situationally appropriate, least part world study done.
people two three times week. terms protocol
might export study, basically getting outside 30 minutes, two
three times week minimum clothing, yet still wearing enough clothing

back front. just moving things. read,
talk, go activities, weren't wearing broad brim hat
hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects
study involving people getting outside 20 30 minutes per day sunlight,
minimum clothing. increase testosterone observed men
women.

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top

deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments

biology light, meaning light converted signals brain body
can use impact things like organ health disease, can use light order
repair particular organs, like skin, eyes, brain, et cetera. physics
light can made simple just illustrating key bullet points. first bullet
point light electromagnetic energy. word electromagnetic feels daunting
you, well, just discard just think light energy think energy
something can impact things environment. Now, way imagine light
conceptualize light energy around light traveling little
wavelengths. reason, watching, making little
wavey motion hand actually way light energy moves little
waves. Just like sound waves coming impinging ears, can
hear talking right now, happening, sound waves, meaning
movement air particles impacting ear drum. Well, light energy just
little bits electromagnetic energy traveling environment time
little waves impinging brain body eyes, et cetera.
mentioned before, energy can change way things behave. can cause
reactions cells body. can cause reactions fruit, instance, right? see
piece fruit not ripe, gets lot sunlight ripens.
electromagnetic energy sunlight impact plant tree, even
fruit directly. parallel example energy ability impact things,
familiar food fact food calories. Calorie measure
energy. everything much heat generated burn
particular article food, believe not. turns hot given article
food burns gives sense much energy can provide body terms
body's ability store use energy. again, think light electromagnetic
energy,

00:12:23 Wavelengths Light

really put word energy capital letters, embed mind, going
forward, understand first bullet point light terms
physics light. Now, second thing need understand physics
light light many different wavelengths, simplest way conceptualize
imagine cover Pink Floyd album, prism.


white beam light going prism. prism splits beam light
looks like rainbow. got reds, orange, greens, blues,
purples, et cetera. Anytime light environment, so-called white
light. includes wavelengths, sunlight forms light also
wavelengths light can't see. think rainbow,
just visible spectrum light. also wavelengths light not visible
us, visible animals, can still impact brain
body still energy wavelengths. give examples this.
Humans not species can see infrared realm spectrum. pit
viper, meaning snake infrared sensors, however, can sense infrared.
walk jungle pit viper there, sees cloud
heat emission body emitting infrared energy time.
casting off infrared energy. snake can see it, can't. put
particular set goggles infrared goggles, well, able see
heat emissions organism, human otherwise, emit infrared
energy. take opposite end spectrum. familiar seeing things
blue green pale blue. say that, meaning even shorter
wavelength light there. Ultraviolet light really good example light energy
coming sun environment reflected off surfaces
time. don't see it. yet, bright outside, ultraviolet light can
burn skin. learn today's episode, ultraviolet light can also positively
impact us. fact, will describe particular set new results show ultraviolet
light viewed just minutes day, landing skin just minutes
day, can actually offset lot pain. actually ability reduce amount
pain sensed body. now understand specific circuits brain
body allow happen. talk related protocols little bit
later. important thing understand physics light
energy different wavelengths. see wavelengths,
basically say light impacts us many different levels. so-called
levels referring different wavelengths light. welcome
think different wavelengths light different colors, understand
truly colors light

00:15:38 Light Penetrates Tissues



can't see, yet powerful impact brain body. Now,
third bullet point understand physics light different wavelengths
light, way wave travels, can penetrate tissues different
depths. very, important. Today, going talk lot red light
therapies near-infrared light therapies. called longer wavelengths.
Longer wavelengths, just think bigger, longer wave, right? bigger curve,
opposed short wavelength light, going shorter, right? short
wavelength light something like blue green light ultraviolet light. Blue,
green, ultraviolet light, shortwave length light, doesn't tend penetrate
tissues easily. way physics light interacts
physical properties skin tissues body. basically,
shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone
marrow. many people, will hard conceptualize. think, "Well, wait,
got skin there. Doesn't light just bounce off?" answer no,
way long wavelength light interacts absorbance properties
skin. Absorbance properties just way skin takes light energy
converts different form energy. skin not able take long
wavelength light, like red light near-infrared light, absorb it. tissues
deeper body can. shine red light near-infrared light onto surface
skin, see red glow reflectance surface skin.
lot photon energy, light energy longer wavelengths indeed
passing top layers skin, deeper layers skin, can even
make deep layers arm. start transition physics
light biological impacts light, just understanding different wavelengths
light impact tissues different levels, literally different depths, will help better
understand light different colors, different intensities long
exposed colors intensities light can change way cells


organs body work. didn't sound weird enough can pass light
particular tissues land absorbed tissues deeper
body, well, turns different wavelengths light also best absorbed
particular so-called organelles within cells. organelles? Organelles
different compartments different functions within given cell. instance,
mitochondria, responsible generating ATP energy cells,
exist particular depth, particular location within cell. not cell
surface. sit somewhat deeper cell. nucleus individual cells
contains DNA, sits particular depth location within cell. Different
wavelengths light not can penetrate different tissues different
cells body, can also penetrate access particular organelles,
meaning mitochondria nucleus different aspects cells
responsible different functions. exquisitely important, exquisitely
powerful learn today, particular wavelengths light can used
stimulate function particular organelles within particular cells, within particular
organs body. can think no form energy, not sound, not chemical
energy, not drugs, not food, not touch, no form energy can target particular
locations cells, organelles, organs body, extent
light can. words, imagine real world surgical tool
modulate biology,

00:20:13 Light & Body: Direct & Indirect Signals

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table
surface. absorbance properties given surface will determine whether not
light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go
episode vision. photoreceptors back eye, absorbing light
different wavelengths, rods, cones. place, course, light can
impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call
pigment melanin. within skin multiple cell types, top layer skin,


called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course
wide variation degree pigmentation skin,
genetics, also born raised, much light
exposure throughout year, right? people toward equator tend
melanocyte activity people located North Pole.
course, people live different locations throughout Earth, regardless genetic
background born. so, know, light exposure,
melanocytes will turn genetic programs biological programs lead
enhanced pigmentation skin, call tanning. way
absorbing UV light specifically. melanocytes, specific example
pigment absorbs light particular length, case, ultraviolet shortwave
length light, turn creates set biological signals within cells turn
creates changes skin pigmentation. photoreceptors,
melanocytes. third example like provide every cell body.
mean every cell body, meaning cell part
bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell
type, informs another cell type, relays signal kind bucket
brigade manner off spleen says spleen, "Hey, lot UV light
here. actually stress. fact, much UV light need
activate immune program protect skin." response that, spleen can
deploy certain signals certain cell types go start repairing skin


damaged UV light. direct signals indirect signals,
every case, starts light particular wavelengths absorbed particular
pigments properties surfaces light waves land on. recall
discussion physics light, remember, not just light
impinging surface body. Light can actually penetrate deep skin
access least certain tissues cells body. Even though can't see

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories

protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according

described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,

sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock

tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright

imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way

higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler

melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across

entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim

perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test

sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart

talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light

questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not

particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red

shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone

photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little

just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light

three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,

red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light

nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin

established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every

getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice

looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,

important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large

fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.

higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler

melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

can't see, yet powerful impact brain body. Now,
third bullet point understand physics light different wavelengths
light, way wave travels, can penetrate tissues different
depths. very, important. Today, going talk lot red light
therapies near-infrared light therapies. called longer wavelengths.
Longer wavelengths, just think bigger, longer wave, right? bigger curve,
opposed short wavelength light, going shorter, right? short
wavelength light something like blue green light ultraviolet light. Blue,
green, ultraviolet light, shortwave length light, doesn't tend penetrate
tissues easily. way physics light interacts
physical properties skin tissues body. basically,
shine UV light onto arm, instance, impact skin surface
arm, maybe cells just beneath top layer skin, wouldn't
penetrate much deeper. Long wavelength light like red light near-infrared light
amazing ability penetrate tissues, including skin.
shine red light near-infrared light onto arm, pass top layer
skin. might impact little bit, penetrate deeper skin, not just
skin layers, maybe even bone, maybe even bone
marrow. many people, will hard conceptualize. think, "Well, wait,
got skin there. Doesn't light just bounce off?" answer no,
way long wavelength light interacts absorbance properties
skin. Absorbance properties just way skin takes light energy
converts different form energy. skin not able take long
wavelength light, like red light near-infrared light, absorb it. tissues
deeper body can. shine red light near-infrared light onto surface
skin, see red glow reflectance surface skin.
lot photon energy, light energy longer wavelengths indeed
passing top layers skin, deeper layers skin, can even
make deep layers arm. start transition physics
light biological impacts light, just understanding different wavelengths
light impact tissues different levels, literally different depths, will help better
understand light different colors, different intensities long
exposed colors intensities light can change way cells


organs body work. didn't sound weird enough can pass light
particular tissues land absorbed tissues deeper
body, well, turns different wavelengths light also best absorbed
particular so-called organelles within cells. organelles? Organelles
different compartments different functions within given cell. instance,
mitochondria, responsible generating ATP energy cells,
exist particular depth, particular location within cell. not cell
surface. sit somewhat deeper cell. nucleus individual cells
contains DNA, sits particular depth location within cell. Different
wavelengths light not can penetrate different tissues different
cells body, can also penetrate access particular organelles,
meaning mitochondria nucleus different aspects cells
responsible different functions. exquisitely important, exquisitely
powerful learn today, particular wavelengths light can used
stimulate function particular organelles within particular cells, within particular
organs body. can think no form energy, not sound, not chemical
energy, not drugs, not food, not touch, no form energy can target particular

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table
surface. absorbance properties given surface will determine whether not
light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go
episode vision. photoreceptors back eye, absorbing light
different wavelengths, rods, cones. place, course, light can
impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call
pigment melanin. within skin multiple cell types, top layer skin,


called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course
wide variation degree pigmentation skin,
genetics, also born raised, much light
exposure throughout year, right? people toward equator tend
melanocyte activity people located North Pole.
course, people live different locations throughout Earth, regardless genetic
background born. so, know, light exposure,
melanocytes will turn genetic programs biological programs lead
enhanced pigmentation skin, call tanning. way
absorbing UV light specifically. melanocytes, specific example
pigment absorbs light particular length, case, ultraviolet shortwave
length light, turn creates set biological signals within cells turn
creates changes skin pigmentation. photoreceptors,
melanocytes. third example like provide every cell body.
mean every cell body, meaning cell part
bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell
type, informs another cell type, relays signal kind bucket
brigade manner off spleen says spleen, "Hey, lot UV light

deploy certain signals certain cell types go start repairing skin

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects

also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can

can activate immune system. among potent antioxidants.
known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking

00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB

access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people
receive dose UVB light exposure 20 30 minutes outdoors.
people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses. people wore sleeveless

hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian

well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day

another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,

interesting study took human subjects, young adults,

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments

light sharpest precise tools. Now, talk
light converted biological signals. several ways
accomplished, fundamental thing understand notion absorption
light energy. Certain pigments colors thing receiving light energy,
meaning thing light energy lands on, going absorb particular
wavelengths light. Now, promise already intuitively know
works. instance, sit outside bright sunny day,
table front metal, might find hard look metal table
reflecting lot light particular wavelengths. table pitch
black, however, wouldn't reflect quite much, able comfortably
look it. table red, might somewhere between. table


green, also somewhere between, say light blue. Well,
might reflect almost much table just metal white table

light energy goes stays location impact location
whether not bounces off. Every biological function light
absorbance reflectance light light passing particular thing,
meaning particular cell compartment within cell. like make clear
works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light
energy, photon energy, red, green, blue, yellow, doesn't matter,
long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different
photopigments. much example gave before, different tables
outside sunny environment, reflecting light others, others
absorbing light others, well, too, photoreceptors, meaning
cones, absorbing light different wavelengths different extents.
absolutely incredible way, brain actually able take information create
perception color. another story altogether just
touch little bit later, want learn about, can go
episode vision. photoreceptors back eye, absorbing light
different wavelengths, rods, cones. place, course, light can
impact body surface, skin. skin pigment too. call
pigment melanin. within skin multiple cell types, top layer skin,


called epidermis, keratinocytes, melanocytes.
melanocytes cells create pigmentation skin. course
wide variation degree pigmentation skin,
genetics, also born raised, much light

course, people live different locations throughout Earth, regardless genetic

absorbing UV light specifically. melanocytes, specific example
pigment absorbs light particular length, case, ultraviolet shortwave

bone tissue bone marrow heart tissue liver spleen, light can
access cells, will change way cells function better worse.
many organs within body reside deep skin, light never arrives
cells. really good example touch later spleen. Unless
massive damage body surface, unless literally hole
body, light will never land directly spleen, spleen still responds light
information indirect pathways. indirect pathways arise light
arriving skin light arriving eyes. key principle going
return today ways light can impact biology
organelles, cells, organs, tissues, indeed whole body,
can either direct, instance, light onto skin impacting skin light onto
photoreceptors impacting photoreceptors eye, can indirect. can
light arriving photoreceptors, photoreceptors informing another cell
type, informs another cell type, relays signal kind bucket

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects

also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,

regulating bone mass. mentioned before, melatonin also protective effects.
can activate immune system. among potent antioxidants.
known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking
levels melatonin supplementing it, spending time darkness not
getting light, would, course, inhibit melatonin, going beneficial
combating cancer. not way works. actually rise fall melatonin

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer

harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed

sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days

first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall

light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved

always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

works using three primary examples take light environment
convert biological events. photoreceptors back eyes.
photoreceptors come two major types, so-called rods cones.
rods elongated, look like rods. cones look like little triangles. Rods
cones within photopigment. dark stuff stacked little
layers. Rods absorb light essentially wavelength. variation that,
just say rods don't care different colors light. will absorb light

long light bright enough. turns rods very, sensitive.
can detect very, small numbers photons. rods essentially
use see low light conditions. return vision later. cones come
three major varieties. least people aren't colorblind, so-
called red cones, green cones, blue cones. not really red, green,
blue back eye. cones either absorb long wavelength light,
red, absorb medium wavelength light, green, short wavelength light, blue.
reason can absorb different wavelengths light different

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep

also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,

information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information

getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock

can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men

observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way

collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant

progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler

melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across

bad damaging retinal tissues. Certainly, wouldn't want taking
bright light high intensity kind getting cavalier that. Typically,
local illumination say wound particular patch acne form skin

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim
condition three lux somewhat dim condition hundred lux not actually
perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart

increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose

indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even
fall asleep sleep whole night through, room sleeping

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not

particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects

also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can

00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB

think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects

sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.

again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children

00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days

first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence

idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach
friends, people get burned easily, others don't. really prioritize

impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased
longer day conditions. saw effects UVB hormones mating,


again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even

again, two parallel pathways. theme going hear
again, not just episode, episodes Huberman

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway

gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB

perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources

psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,

that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects
depending ratios levels hormones biological events
body. can see, melatonin powerful regulatory tissues.
also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can
developing fetus placenta. people not pregnant, fact, people,
melatonin powerful effect central nervous system whole. brain
spinal cord major components central nervous system ,
melatonin, associated darkness, just another way saying
light suppresses melatonin, melatonin thereby associated dark phase
24-hour cycle, can number different effects terms waking

whole cascade biological mechanisms, bit detailed get
today. melatonin regulating awake asleep are. tends make us

regulating bone mass. mentioned before, melatonin also protective effects.
can activate immune system. among potent antioxidants.
known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking
levels melatonin supplementing it, spending time darkness not
getting light, would, course, inhibit melatonin, going beneficial
combating cancer. not way works. actually rise fall melatonin
every 24-hour cycle changes duration melatonin signal throughout

light impacting biology, reason bring melatonin primary example
A, melatonin impacts many important functions within brain
body, also hormones general, not always, general, responsible

organs body working, melatonin transducer signal.
point, can say light powerfully modulates melatonin, meaning shuts
melatonin. Melatonin beneficial certain tissues



00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days

hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence

idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking

circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top

deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen

tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments

beautiful. least me, beautiful means environment
around us converted signal

00:33:40 Melatonin: Regulatory & Protective Effects

changes environment within us. signal melatonin, melatonin well
known role making us sleepy night allowing us fall asleep. Many
probably heard before, not big fan melatonin supplementation
number reasons, just quick aside, levels melatonin
supplements far high really considered physiological. indeed
super physiological cases, melatonin can number different effects,
not just related sleep, supplemented melatonin. Here, talking
natural production release melatonin according 365-day
calendar year. Endogenous melatonin, meaning melatonin make within
bodies naturally, not melatonin supplemented, two general categories
effects. first set effects called regulatory effects others
protective effects. regulatory effects instance, melatonin can positively
impact bone mass. melatonin can, instance, turn production osteoblasts,
essentially stem cells make bone us make bones
stronger can replace damaged aspects bone. Melatonin also involved
maturation gonads puberty, ovaries testes. Although there,
effects melatonin tend suppressive maturation ovaries testes,
meaning high levels melatonin tend reduce testicle volume reduce certain
functions within testes, including sperm production testosterone production.
within ovaries, melatonin can suppress maturation eggs, et cetera. Now,
don't want anyone get scared taking melatonin. effects
melatonin functions reversible, point one
reasons children don't go puberty particular age young children
tend chronically high endogenous melatonin. healthy keep
puberty right time puberty happen. melatonin can increase
bone mass, reduces gonad mass, speak. going varying effects
depending ratios levels hormones biological events
body. can see, melatonin powerful regulatory tissues.
also mention melatonin powerful modulator placental development.


anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can
developing fetus placenta. people not pregnant, fact, people,
melatonin powerful effect central nervous system whole. brain
spinal cord major components central nervous system ,
melatonin, associated darkness, just another way saying
light suppresses melatonin, melatonin thereby associated dark phase
24-hour cycle, can number different effects terms waking
making body feel sleepy. way impacting cells within
nervous system, literally turning certain brain areas, turning off brain areas.
whole cascade biological mechanisms, bit detailed get
today. melatonin regulating awake asleep are. tends make us
asleep, incidentally. regulating timing puberty, regulating
gonads, testes ovaries, function, even adulthood, extent.
regulating bone mass. mentioned before, melatonin also protective effects.
can activate immune system. among potent antioxidants.
known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking
levels melatonin supplementing it, spending time darkness not
getting light, would, course, inhibit melatonin, going beneficial
combating cancer. not way works. actually rise fall melatonin
every 24-hour cycle changes duration melatonin signal throughout
seasons anti-cancer antioxidant effects. think
light impacting biology, reason bring melatonin primary example
A, melatonin impacts many important functions within brain
body, also hormones general, not always, general, responsible
slow modulatory effects biology. using example
light throughout year changing way different cells tissues
organs body working, melatonin transducer signal.
point, can say light powerfully modulates melatonin, meaning shuts
melatonin. Melatonin beneficial certain tissues



00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure
eyes face skin throughout day, provided not
getting sunburnt. actually healthy thing mood energy throughout
day. night, basically hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
even tiny bit UVB exposure artificial sources can mess us terms

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people
receive dose UVB light exposure 20 30 minutes outdoors.
people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses. people wore sleeveless
shirts. encouraged people wear shorts. indeed wearing clothing.

hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects
study involving people getting outside 20 30 minutes per day sunlight,

recommendation people get much bright light exposure safely can
morning throughout day sake sleep energy, also
enhancing mood regulating appetite. study, found males
females higher levels romantic passion getting UV treatment. fact,
reported increases romantic passion just one two UV
treatments. didn't go 10 12 order get statistically
significant increase passion. Now, talk passion, authors
paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide
reference link study like look details. found
women receiving UVB light exposure focused increases
physical arousal sexual passion, whereas men actually scored higher
cognitive dimensions passion, obsessive thoughts partner
on. Regardless, males females experienced reported increase sexual
passion desire mate. now know increases testosterone


estrogen, course driving psychological changes, although sure
interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual
passion. Now, opinion, noteworthy study really illustrates
sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

01:02:13 Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone

can directly trigger hormone pathways desire mate mating behavior. Now,
study went step defining precise mechanism light can
impact hormones desire mate. here, understanding
mechanism key want export particular protocol tool might apply.
talked earlier UVB light exposure eyes triggers activation
particular neurons within eye, centers deeper brain,
eventually pineal gland suppress output melatonin thereby allow

testosterone estrogen. study, able clearly establish
sunlight exposure skin causing hormone increases
observed mice humans. way use so-called
knockout technology, ability remove specific genes within specific tissues
body. found UVB light, meaning sunlight-exposed skin,
upregulated, meaning increased activity something called p53, involved
maturation cells various aspects cellular function. cells
focused keratinocytes, now familiar earlier
discussion fact epidermis skin contains mainly keratinocytes
melanocytes. Sunlight exposure increased p53 activity skin. p53 activity
required downstream increases ovarian size, testicular size,
testosterone increases, estrogen increases, various changes


observed physiological level animals humans exposed
sunlight. data important mean not
important get sunlight exposure early day throughout day
eyes, least much safely possible, also need get UVB sunlight
exposure onto skin want activate p53 pathway keratinocytes
testosterone estrogen increases downstream p53 pathway. even
though gene knockout studies done mice, clearly show
remove p53 skin, effects simply not occur. terms thinking
protocol increase testosterone estrogen, mood feelings passion,
idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach
friends, people get burned easily, others don't. really prioritize
health avoidance sunburn skin. However, data
data point fact probably striving get sunlight

impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased
longer day conditions. saw effects UVB hormones mating,


again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even

referring endorphins body naturally manufactures releases order
counter pain act somewhat psychological soother also, because, course,
physical pain emotional pain intimately linked brain body.
found exposure UVB light increased release beta-endorphins.
caused essentially release endogenous pain killer. Now, second study
came recently, just last week, fact, published journal Neuron, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, entitled Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking

circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top

deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen

tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive

anyone pregnant, considering melatonin supplementation, please,
please, please talk OB/GYN, talk doctor well. want
very, cautious powerful effects melatonin can
developing fetus placenta. people not pregnant, fact, people,
melatonin powerful effect central nervous system whole. brain
spinal cord major components central nervous system ,
melatonin, associated darkness, just another way saying
light suppresses melatonin, melatonin thereby associated dark phase
24-hour cycle, can number different effects terms waking

gonads, testes ovaries, function, even adulthood, extent.
regulating bone mass. mentioned before, melatonin also protective effects.
can activate immune system. among potent antioxidants.
known certain anti-cancer properties things sort, not say
simply want melatonin. think lot people get misled hear
something like, melatonin anti-cancer properties. doesn't mean cranking
levels melatonin supplementing it, spending time darkness not
getting light, would, course, inhibit melatonin, going beneficial
combating cancer. not way works. actually rise fall melatonin
every 24-hour cycle changes duration melatonin signal throughout

light impacting biology, reason bring melatonin primary example
A, melatonin impacts many important functions within brain
body, also hormones general, not always, general, responsible
slow modulatory effects biology. using example
light throughout year changing way different cells tissues
organs body working, melatonin transducer signal.
point, can say light powerfully modulates melatonin, meaning shuts
melatonin. Melatonin beneficial certain tissues



00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people

10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects

paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide

women receiving UVB light exposure focused increases
physical arousal sexual passion, whereas men actually scored higher
cognitive dimensions passion, obsessive thoughts partner
on. Regardless, males females experienced reported increase sexual
passion desire mate. now know increases testosterone

interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual
passion. Now, opinion, noteworthy study really illustrates
sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

01:02:13 Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone

can directly trigger hormone pathways desire mate mating behavior. Now,
study went step defining precise mechanism light can
impact hormones desire mate. here, understanding
mechanism key want export particular protocol tool might apply.
talked earlier UVB light exposure eyes triggers activation
particular neurons within eye, centers deeper brain,
eventually pineal gland suppress output melatonin thereby allow

testosterone estrogen. study, able clearly establish
sunlight exposure skin causing hormone increases
observed mice humans. way use so-called

focused keratinocytes, now familiar earlier
discussion fact epidermis skin contains mainly keratinocytes
melanocytes. Sunlight exposure increased p53 activity skin. p53 activity
required downstream increases ovarian size, testicular size,
testosterone increases, estrogen increases, various changes


observed physiological level animals humans exposed
sunlight. data important mean not
important get sunlight exposure early day throughout day
eyes, least much safely possible, also need get UVB sunlight
exposure onto skin want activate p53 pathway keratinocytes
testosterone estrogen increases downstream p53 pathway. even
though gene knockout studies done mice, clearly show
remove p53 skin, effects simply not occur. terms thinking
protocol increase testosterone estrogen, mood feelings passion,
idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach
friends, people get burned easily, others don't. really prioritize
health avoidance sunburn skin. However, data
data point fact probably striving get sunlight

01:06:13 Light & Improved Pain Tolerance

summer months, provided can without damaging skin. Another set
impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased
longer day conditions. saw effects UVB hormones mating,


again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even
one exposure UVB light changed output particular hormones
neurochemicals body, corticotropin hormone beta-endorphins,
endogenous opioids. heard opioid crisis, people
getting addicted opioids taking drug form, pharmaceuticals.
referring endorphins body naturally manufactures releases order
counter pain act somewhat psychological soother also, because, course,
physical pain emotional pain intimately linked brain body.
found exposure UVB light increased release beta-endorphins.
caused essentially release endogenous pain killer. Now, second study
came recently, just last week, fact, published journal Neuron, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, entitled Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal
Gray Area Antinociceptive Effects Bright Light Treatment. translate little bit
you. periaqueductal gray region mid-brain contains lot
neurons can release endogenous opioids, things like beta-enkephalin, things like
enkephalin, things like mu opioid. names chemicals body can
manufacture act endogenous pain killers increase tolerance pain.
actually make feel less pain overall shutting neurons
perceive pain reducing activity. Not dangerous level, right? not
going block pain response burn unnecessarily harm
unnecessarily, act bit pain killer inside. heard
word antinociceptive, nociception basically perception way neurons
respond painful stimuli. can think nociceptive events nervous system
painful events. using broad brush. realized experts pain
will say, "Oh, not really pain circuit," et cetera, et cetera. sake today's
discussion, fair say nociception perception pain. title
Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal Gray, area releases

key finding study light landing eyes captured
specific cells talking earlier, intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin
ganglion cells long name them, particular neurons eye,
eye incidentally, communicate particular brain areas. brain areas

melanopsin cells. absorb light, translate light electrical signals
handed off areas brain, ventral geniculate.
ventral geniculate communicates periaqueductal gray area evoke release
endogenous opioids soothe lead less perception pain.
really important study long known longer days bright light
environments, tolerate emotional physical pain better. Previous studies
shown light landing skin mediates effect, part.
couldn't explain entire effect. recent study indicates also light
arriving eyes, case, again, UVB light, ultraviolet blue light sort
comes sunlight, triggering anti-pain pain-relieving pathways.
again, two parallel pathways. theme going hear
again, not just episode, episodes Huberman
Lab Podcast, way brain body built. Nature rarely
relies one mechanism order create important phenomenon, pain relief
important phenomenon. now least two examples potent effects

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

00:38:49 Tools: Optimizing Melatonin Levels

suppressive tissues functions.
information? Well, well established now one best things can
get proper amount sunlight day. proper, mean
appropriate time year. summer months days longer
nights shorter, well get sunlight eyes. again,
going eyes recall, pineal sits deep brain,
light can't access pineal directly, least not humans. order get light
information pineal thereby get proper levels melatonin according
time year, try get outside much possible long days
summer spring. winter months, makes sense spend time
indoors. suffer seasonal effective disorder,
seasonal depression, feel low fall winter months, ways
offset this. entire episode mood circadian rhythms
described this. make sense people get bright light
eyes early morning throughout day winter months well.
nonetheless, changes melatonin, meaning changes duration melatonin
release across year normal healthy. provided not suffering
depression, going healthy somewhat modulate amount indoor
outdoor time across year. thing understand firmly
established fact, light powerfully inhibits melatonin. wake middle
night, go bathroom flip lights,
bright, overhead, fluorescent lights, melatonin levels, ordinarily
quite high middle night eyes closed dark,
presumably, will immediately plummet near zero zero. well
regardless time year not destroy melatonin middle night
way. need get middle night use restroom,
perfectly normal behavior many people, use minimum amount light required
order safely move environment need move through. Melatonin
needs come early night. actually starts rising evening towards
sleep. close eyes go sleep, melatonin levels going
continue rise least several hours night. Again, get
middle night, really try hard not flip lot bright lights. every


while, not going problem. night night,
really disrupting fundamental signal occurs every night, regardless
winter, spring, summer, et cetera. communicating information
brain body time. know little bit tricky concept,
really body not meant function way winter months,
summer months. functions specifically optimal shorter days
winter. functions specifically optimal longer days
summer. again, try avoid bright light exposure eyes middle
night. shift work, can say try avoid
getting bright light eyes middle sleep cycle. even
sleeping middle day, work night, wake
sleep, really try hard limit amount light, going
harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available
without prescription, counter. just go pharmacy drugstore order
online, hormone, known powerful effects. get very,
concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people

hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects
study involving people getting outside 20 30 minutes per day sunlight,

paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide

interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual
passion. Now, opinion, noteworthy study really illustrates
sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach

again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

harder shift workers, right? generally lot lights
bright lights outside, want close blinds limit artificial light inside.
One way bypass inhibitory effects light melatonin change
physical environment by, instance, dimming lights. one simple way,
low-cost way. fact, save money dimming lights turning off.
going use light, using long wavelength light, because, recall,
intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin cells within retina convey
signal bright light environment impact melatonin, shut
melatonin, respond short wavelengths light. red light long wavelength light.
now understand discussion physics light.
use amber-colored light red light even better, dim amber dim red light
middle night, well, probably not reduce melatonin unless
red lights amber lights very, bright. light, provided bright
enough, will shut melatonin production. One final point melatonin,
relates melatonin supplementation well, now understand
potently melatonin can impact things like cardiovascular function, immune function, anti-
cancer properties, bone mass, gonad function, et cetera, can understand
make sense cautious melatonin supplementation,
supplementation tends pretty static. X number milligrams per night, whereas
normally endogenously amount melatonin releasing night
changing according time year, happen live area isn't
much change day length across year, instance, live near equator,


well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days

first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free

used long time, can basically point phone particular light

readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light

talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger

well, body accustomed regular amounts melatonin night.
start supplementing melatonin, start changing total amount
melatonin, obviously, also changing normal rhythms much
melatonin released brain body across 365-day calendar year.
somebody readily embraces supplementation various forms,
things like sleep focus, et cetera, comes melatonin, extremely
cautious. think also one examples hormone available

concerned hear people taking melatonin,

00:44:49 Sun (UVB light) Exposure, Mating Behavior, Testosterone & Estrogen

especially levels present supplements. recognized
long time, fact, now data support fact animals
kinds, including humans, will seek mates engage mating behavior
frequently long days spring summer. right, seasonally-
breeding animals, course, case, humans well,
seeking mates mating behavior longer day times year. Now,
imagine least two mechanisms occurs. first mechanism
easily map melatonin fact melatonin suppressive various aspects
so-called gonadal axis, basically fancy way saying melatonin
inhibits testosterone estrogen output testes ovaries. just
want remind people males females make testosterone estrogen,
although different ratios, typically, males versus females, testosterone
estrogen critical desire mate mating behavior. broad
misconception testosterone involved mating behavior estrogen's involved
behaviors, enough estrogen critical males females
order maintain desire mate, indeed ability mate. discuss
episode optimizing testosterone estrogen. like details that,
please see episode Huberman Lab Podcast. Okay, melatonin
suppressive so-called gonadal axis reduces overall levels testosterone
estrogen males females light inhibits melatonin,
light, less melatonin hormone output gonads. indeed


system works, not entire story. turns
second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure

hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects

paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide

interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual

sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

01:02:13 Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone

can directly trigger hormone pathways desire mate mating behavior. Now,
study went step defining precise mechanism light can
impact hormones desire mate. here, understanding

sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.

again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not

particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-

right? sure many people interested can

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-

neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may

work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red

wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain

visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons

second so-called parallel pathway, meaning different biological pathway operates
parallel light suppression melatonin pathway provides basis longer
days, inspiring desire mate mating behavior. think first
pathway involving melatonin sort break reproductive hormones,
second mechanism like accelerator hormones. yet still involve
light. tell you, animals mice, also humans, exposure
light, particular UV blue light, short wavelengths light, can trigger increases
testosterone estrogen desire mate. Now especially important
accelerator desire mate mating behavior hormones
driven exposure light, not exposure light eyes. turns
exposure skin particular wavelengths light triggering
increases hormones, testosterone, estrogen, leading increased desire
mate. turns out, skin, us just think way protect
organs body something hang clothes ornaments on,
somebody earrings forth, skin actually endocrine organ,
meaning hormone-producing hormone-influencing organ. promise
tell next will forever change way think skin light
desire mate, indeed even mating behavior. think results best
understood simply going primary data, meaning actual research
topic. so, going review recent paper published
Journal Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal. paper came
2021, entitled "Skin Exposure UVB light induces skin, brain, gonad axis,
sexual behavior. want emphasize paper focused mice
order address specific mechanisms, mice, can so-called knock
particular genes. can remove particular genes understand mechanism. just
can't humans kind controlled way, least not point time.
study also explores humans looked human subjects, men
women. basic finding study mice humans exposed
UVB, meaning ultraviolet blue light, shortwave length light sort comes
sunshine, also available various artificial sources.
received enough exposure light skin, increases testosterone
observed within brief period time, also increases hormone
estrogen. point proper ratios estrogen testosterone


maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical

always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.

40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan

particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning

visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will

figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,

also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns

found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma

maintained males females, least far data indicate, mice
tended seek mating mate more. also increases gonadal
weight, literally increases testy size ovarian size mice exposed
UVB light past certain threshold. Now, mentioned before, study also
looked humans. not look testy size ovarian size human subjects.
However, humans, address psychology human
beings addressed whether not increases in, instance,
aggressiveness passionate feelings perception people
changed getting lot UVB light exposure skin. get
important details study done
can leverage information yourself, desire, just want highlight
basic findings overall. UVB exposure increased so-called sex steroid levels
mice humans. sex steroid hormones, say steroids, don't mean
anabolic steroids taken exogenously. think people hear word steroids,
always think steroid abuse use, rather. Steroid hormones, testosterone
estrogen, went mice humans lot UVB exposure skin.
Second all, UVB light exposure skin enhanced female attractiveness,
perceived attractiveness females males, increased receptiveness
desire mate sexes. UVB light exposure also changed various aspects
female biology related fertility, particular follicle growth. Follicle egg maturation
well-known indices fertility, course, correlate menstrual cycle
adult humans related overall propensity become pregnant. UVB light
exposure enhanced maturation follicle, just meant healthy eggs
produced. impressive effects. First all, looked large
number variables study. fact looked mice humans
terrific. think oftentimes find hard translate data mice humans.
fact looked parallel wonderful. mice humans,
established protocol essentially involved exposing skin UV light
equivalent 20 30 minutes midday sun exposure. Now, course,
live world will dictate whether not midday sun very, bright
intense less bright. Maybe cloud cover, et cetera. since
imagining people interested ways increase testosterone and/or
estrogen humans not much interested increasing testosterone mice,
going just review human population human subjects.


people, first all, establish baseline. way
established baseline little bit unusual, will make perfect sense you.
people wear long sleeves essentially cover avoid sunlight days
measure baseline hormones absence getting lot UVB
light exposure sun sources. Now, course, people
access artificial lights, pointed podcast before, pretty unusual
get enough UVB exposure artificial lights throughout day.
morning need lot UVB exposure, getting lot UVB exposure
eyes face skin throughout day, provided not
getting sunburnt. actually healthy thing mood energy throughout
day. night, basically hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
even tiny bit UVB exposure artificial sources can mess us terms

people getting artificial light exposure throughout day, weren't
getting outside lot. weren't getting lot sunlight. people

people wear short sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses. people wore sleeveless
shirts. encouraged people wear shorts. indeed wearing clothing.
not naked. wearing clothing culturally
situationally appropriate, least part world study done.
people two three times week. terms protocol
might export study, basically getting outside 30 minutes, two
three times week minimum clothing, yet still wearing enough clothing

talk, go activities, weren't wearing broad brim hat
hat kind, just getting lot sun exposure skin. total
10 12 UVB treatments. took several weeks, right? took month,
think it, two three times per week total 10 12 UVB treatments.
treatments, course, just outside sun. measured
hormones, measured psychology male female adult subjects.
first look psychological changes human subjects experienced
getting 10 12 UVB light exposure outdoor sunlight type treatments.


collecting blood samples throughout study, saw significant
increases hormones, beta-estradiol, one major forms estrogen,
progesterone, another important steroid hormone, testosterone men
women. Now, important point testosterone increases significantly
higher men happened originate countries low UV exposure
compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require
sunlight order allow vitamin D3 synthesized perform roles body.
turns people darker skin actually need vitamin D3 and/or
sunlight exposure order activate D3 pathway, people paler
skin. make sense given now understand
melanocytes, cell type discussed earlier, melanocytes
pigment within them. darker skin, means
melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale
skin, light lands skin can trigger synthesis assist
actions vitamin D3. Similarly, study, found people paler skin
and/or originated countries less UVB light exposure across
year greater, meaning significant, increases testosterone overall
people already getting lot UVB exposure. led explore so-
called seasonal changes testosterone occurred normally absence
light exposure treatment. now, talking aspects
study involving people getting outside 20 30 minutes per day sunlight,
minimum clothing. increase testosterone observed men
women.

thereby function much sunlight exposure getting.
remarkable data map well data mice
data paper humans, illustrate getting UVB exposure,

well known sunlight exposure eyes can increase mood. talked
podcast episode guest, Dr. Samer Hattar, director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health. Samer's
recommendation people get much bright light exposure safely can
morning throughout day sake sleep energy, also
enhancing mood regulating appetite. study, found males
females higher levels romantic passion getting UV treatment. fact,
reported increases romantic passion just one two UV
treatments. didn't go 10 12 order get statistically
significant increase passion. Now, talk passion, authors
paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide
reference link study like look details. found
women receiving UVB light exposure focused increases
physical arousal sexual passion, whereas men actually scored higher
cognitive dimensions passion, obsessive thoughts partner
on. Regardless, males females experienced reported increase sexual
passion desire mate. now know increases testosterone


estrogen, course driving psychological changes, although sure
interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual
passion. Now, opinion, noteworthy study really illustrates
sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

01:02:13 Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone

can directly trigger hormone pathways desire mate mating behavior. Now,
study went step defining precise mechanism light can
impact hormones desire mate. here, understanding
mechanism key want export particular protocol tool might apply.
talked earlier UVB light exposure eyes triggers activation
particular neurons within eye, centers deeper brain,
eventually pineal gland suppress output melatonin thereby allow
testosterone estrogen exist higher levels melatonin can inhibit
testosterone estrogen. study, able clearly establish
sunlight exposure skin causing hormone increases
observed mice humans. way use so-called
knockout technology, ability remove specific genes within specific tissues
body. found UVB light, meaning sunlight-exposed skin,
upregulated, meaning increased activity something called p53, involved
maturation cells various aspects cellular function. cells
focused keratinocytes, now familiar earlier
discussion fact epidermis skin contains mainly keratinocytes
melanocytes. Sunlight exposure increased p53 activity skin. p53 activity
required downstream increases ovarian size, testicular size,
testosterone increases, estrogen increases, various changes


observed physiological level animals humans exposed
sunlight. data important mean not
important get sunlight exposure early day throughout day
eyes, least much safely possible, also need get UVB sunlight
exposure onto skin want activate p53 pathway keratinocytes
testosterone estrogen increases downstream p53 pathway. even
though gene knockout studies done mice, clearly show
remove p53 skin, effects simply not occur. terms thinking
protocol increase testosterone estrogen, mood feelings passion,
idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach
friends, people get burned easily, others don't. really prioritize
health avoidance sunburn skin. However, data
data point fact probably striving get sunlight

impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased

again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even
one exposure UVB light changed output particular hormones
neurochemicals body, corticotropin hormone beta-endorphins,
endogenous opioids. heard opioid crisis, people

referring endorphins body naturally manufactures releases order
counter pain act somewhat psychological soother also, because, course,
physical pain emotional pain intimately linked brain body.
found exposure UVB light increased release beta-endorphins.
caused essentially release endogenous pain killer. Now, second study
came recently, just last week, fact, published journal Neuron, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, entitled Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal
Gray Area Antinociceptive Effects Bright Light Treatment. translate little bit
you. periaqueductal gray region mid-brain contains lot
neurons can release endogenous opioids, things like beta-enkephalin, things like
enkephalin, things like mu opioid. names chemicals body can
manufacture act endogenous pain killers increase tolerance pain.
actually make feel less pain overall shutting neurons
perceive pain reducing activity. Not dangerous level, right? not
going block pain response burn unnecessarily harm
unnecessarily, act bit pain killer inside. heard
word antinociceptive, nociception basically perception way neurons
respond painful stimuli. can think nociceptive events nervous system

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones

specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top

deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen

tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments

compared individuals countries high UV exposure. Now, make
sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require

melanocytes melanocytes efficient creating pigment.
consequence, light lands skin will absorbed
melanocytes, less able impact D3 pathway. Whereas pale

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim

perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux

sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart

describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic

talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized

don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either

12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

sense understand little bit skin functions endocrine organ.
Many probably heard vitamin D3, vitamin make.
Many people supplement well need additional vitamin D3. require

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway

psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person

that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger

episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670
nanometers. 670 nanometers appear red me. They,
that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not
cells responsible moving mouth. rods cones neural
retina responsible using amount ATP energy entire
body. that, cells tend accumulate lot reactive oxygen
species age. Red light sort used studies able reduce
amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones
red cones. just red cones absorb light best. important
takeaway viewing red light near-infrared light distance
safe just couple minutes day allowed reversal aging process
neurons, people heard say before, just say again,

not just near brain. actual central nervous system tissue.
two pieces brain, meaning neuroretinas two pieces


brain reside outside skull, least outside cranial vault.
seeing reversal aging process neurons shining red light neurons.
Now, course, Jeffery Lab primarily interested vision, humans
dependent vision sense navigate world survive. really
wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore
function cells well. little bit studies Jeffery Lab.
One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-
infrared light one use. don't affiliation companies products
promote make red light therapies. red light panel, confess


started using protocol. older 40 years old. also
experimenting red light panels way addressing changes
biological tissues, blood work, et cetera. going talk
future episode, that, course, call anecdata. relates
experience. today, certainly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively, talking anecdata
highlighting anecdata. somebody wants explore red light
therapy, need do. need make sure red light source,
whatever source happen use, whether not purchase make one...
fact, red light sources very, easy make. essentially take
bright flashlight cover film filter allow particular long
wavelengths pass through. easy look online figure
this. probably for, know, just dollars
purchase red light unit within budget something
interested in. want make sure not bright damaging
eye. good rule thumb something isn't painful look at. fact,
just emphasize time look light source, sunlight otherwise,
painful makes want squint close eyes, means bright
look without closing eyes. Okay, sort duh, loathe think
anyone harm bright light way. don't just say
protect us. say protect you, course, responsible

not come back. no technology replace current state
time. please don't damage retinas. red light source safe look
not painful look at? Chances is. yet still encourage talk
optometrist ophthalmologist getting extensive protocols.
still determined pursue sorts protocols Jeffery studies,
certainly provide link studies. Again, involved looking red light
panels, blinking aloud two minutes three minutes every morning period two
weeks more. older 40, well effect.
longer, younger 40, excuse me, unlikely effect. least
observed particular studies. lights not flashing.
continuous illumination. Again, allowed blink. not even direct
illumination. can somewhat indirect illumination, much described use


UVB light before. wavelength light important. red light near-infrared
light going effective scenario. authors study emphasized
red light 670 nanometers wavelength near-infrared light 790
nanometers wavelength effective wavelengths
complimentary. probably why, maybe just coincidental, fortunate
coincidence lot commercially available red light panels find
combine red light near-infrared light. However, want emphasize
panels commercially available going bright safely
look close up. fact, red light panels designed
illumination skin oftentimes arrive packaging eye protectors
actually designed shield red light. take potential dangers
excessive illumination eyes wavelength light seriously.
going explore 670 790 nanometer light sake enhancing neuronal function,

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels



02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive
decline. incredible, right? pattern flashing light delivered eyes
creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce
markers cause age-related cognitive decline Alzheimer's. parallel
that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections
neurons, on, on. discovered list huge
number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,
phototherapy different sort talking now.
phototherapy designed trigger activation biological pathways far away

talking earlier, illumination skin UVB light setting off
enormous number different cascades different organs tissues, including
spleen, testes, ovaries, on. again, light powerful effects,
locally cells light delivered to, also systemically terms
cells changing electrical chemical outputs, modifying lots lots
biological programs. actionable tool related studies yet? Well,


sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,
staring flickering light given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
might surprise you, shouldn't, study illustrates
anyone ever night club something illustrates, look
strobe light, instance, whole world visual perception changes, actually,

not testosterone levels change function time year. measure testosterone
across 12-month calendar. study done subjects living Northern
Hemisphere entire year. months January, February, March,
course, length days shortest length nights longest. And,
course, spring summer months, June, July, August, September, on,
days much longer nights shorter. observed
obvious. observed testosterone levels lowest winter months
highest months June, July, August, September. Now,
important data. least knowledge, first data systematically
exploring levels sex steroid hormones humans function time year
thereby function much sunlight exposure getting.
remarkable data map well data mice
data paper humans, illustrate getting UVB exposure,
testosterone levels higher. study went step explored whether
not amount sunlight exposure one getting skin influences
psychology terms whether not increased desire mate on.
well known sunlight exposure eyes can increase mood. talked
podcast episode guest, Dr. Samer Hattar, director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health. Samer's
recommendation people get much bright light exposure safely can
morning throughout day sake sleep energy, also
enhancing mood regulating appetite. study, found males
females higher levels romantic passion getting UV treatment. fact,
reported increases romantic passion just one two UV
treatments. didn't go 10 12 order get statistically
significant increase passion. Now, talk passion, authors
paper acknowledge, really two forms. emotional sexual,
parse pretty finely. don't want go details, can provide
reference link study like look details. found
women receiving UVB light exposure focused increases
physical arousal sexual passion, whereas men actually scored higher
cognitive dimensions passion, obsessive thoughts partner
on. Regardless, males females experienced reported increase sexual
passion desire mate. now know increases testosterone


estrogen, course driving psychological changes, although sure
interact directions, meaning hormones no doubt affect psychology
no doubt psychology, changes passionate feelings, no doubt also
increased changed hormone levels well. want reemphasize
component study no deliberate daylight, sunlight exposure 20
30 minutes, rather just looked hormone levels throughout year found
increase day length correlated increases testosterone sexual
passion. Now, opinion, noteworthy study really illustrates
sunlight day length can impact melatonin pathway thereby take foot
off brake, speak, testosterone, estrogen, desire mate. also
emphasizes sunlight, UVB light,

01:02:13 Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone

can directly trigger hormone pathways desire mate mating behavior. Now,
study went step defining precise mechanism light can
impact hormones desire mate. here, understanding
mechanism key want export particular protocol tool might apply.
talked earlier UVB light exposure eyes triggers activation
particular neurons within eye, centers deeper brain,
eventually pineal gland suppress output melatonin thereby allow
testosterone estrogen exist higher levels melatonin can inhibit
testosterone estrogen. study, able clearly establish
sunlight exposure skin causing hormone increases
observed mice humans. way use so-called
knockout technology, ability remove specific genes within specific tissues
body. found UVB light, meaning sunlight-exposed skin,
upregulated, meaning increased activity something called p53, involved
maturation cells various aspects cellular function. cells
focused keratinocytes, now familiar earlier
discussion fact epidermis skin contains mainly keratinocytes
melanocytes. Sunlight exposure increased p53 activity skin. p53 activity
required downstream increases ovarian size, testicular size,
testosterone increases, estrogen increases, various changes


observed physiological level animals humans exposed
sunlight. data important mean not
important get sunlight exposure early day throughout day
eyes, least much safely possible, also need get UVB sunlight
exposure onto skin want activate p53 pathway keratinocytes
testosterone estrogen increases downstream p53 pathway. even
though gene knockout studies done mice, clearly show
remove p53 skin, effects simply not occur. terms thinking
protocol increase testosterone estrogen, mood feelings passion,
idea want get two three exposures per week, minimum
20 30 minutes sunlight exposure onto much body can
reasonably expose to. say reasonably, mean, course obey
cultural constraints, decency constraints. course also obey fact
sunlight can burn skin. many people probably going ask, "What
happens wear sunscreen?" Well, theory, sunscreen UV protection,
block effects. Now not suggesting people away
sunscreen entirely. hope episode sunscreen future
sunscreen bit controversial topic. Skin cancers real thing, many
people especially prone skin cancer, need take seriously.
people not prone skin cancers can tolerate much sun exposure.
probably familiar simple fact gone outside beach
friends, people get burned easily, others don't. really prioritize
health avoidance sunburn skin. However, data
data point fact probably striving get sunlight
exposure onto skin winter months still getting sunlight exposure onto
skin

01:06:13 Light & Improved Pain Tolerance

summer months, provided can without damaging skin. Another set
impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased
longer day conditions. saw effects UVB hormones mating,


again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even
one exposure UVB light changed output particular hormones
neurochemicals body, corticotropin hormone beta-endorphins,
endogenous opioids. heard opioid crisis, people
getting addicted opioids taking drug form, pharmaceuticals.
referring endorphins body naturally manufactures releases order
counter pain act somewhat psychological soother also, because, course,
physical pain emotional pain intimately linked brain body.
found exposure UVB light increased release beta-endorphins.
caused essentially release endogenous pain killer. Now, second study
came recently, just last week, fact, published journal Neuron, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, entitled Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal
Gray Area Antinociceptive Effects Bright Light Treatment. translate little bit
you. periaqueductal gray region mid-brain contains lot
neurons can release endogenous opioids, things like beta-enkephalin, things like
enkephalin, things like mu opioid. names chemicals body can
manufacture act endogenous pain killers increase tolerance pain.
actually make feel less pain overall shutting neurons
perceive pain reducing activity. Not dangerous level, right? not
going block pain response burn unnecessarily harm
unnecessarily, act bit pain killer inside. heard
word antinociceptive, nociception basically perception way neurons
respond painful stimuli. can think nociceptive events nervous system
painful events. using broad brush. realized experts pain
will say, "Oh, not really pain circuit," et cetera, et cetera. sake today's
discussion, fair say nociception perception pain. title
Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal Gray, area releases
endogenous opioids antinociceptive, anti-pain effects bright light treatment,


key finding study light landing eyes captured
specific cells talking earlier, intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin
ganglion cells long name them, particular neurons eye,
eye incidentally, communicate particular brain areas. brain areas
names. want know them, aficionados ultra curious folks,
names like ventral lateral geniculate nucleus intergeniculate
leaflet. names don't matter. point light landing eyes captured
melanopsin cells. absorb light, translate light electrical signals
handed off areas brain, ventral geniculate.
ventral geniculate communicates periaqueductal gray area evoke release
endogenous opioids soothe lead less perception pain.
really important study long known longer days bright light
environments, tolerate emotional physical pain better. Previous studies
shown light landing skin mediates effect, part.
couldn't explain entire effect. recent study indicates also light
arriving eyes, case, again, UVB light, ultraviolet blue light sort
comes sunlight, triggering anti-pain pain-relieving pathways.
again, two parallel pathways. theme going hear
again, not just episode, episodes Huberman
Lab Podcast, way brain body built. Nature rarely
relies one mechanism order create important phenomenon, pain relief
important phenomenon. now least two examples potent effects
UVB light exposure skin eyes. One involving activation
testosterone estrogen pathways, relates mating, another relates
reducing total amount

01:11:55 Protocol: Sun Exposure & Chronic Pain

pain experience response painful stimuli.
thinking tools protocols, somebody experiencing chronic pain,
provided can safely, try get UVB exposure, ideally sunlight. think
20 30-minute protocol, two three times per week excellent one, seems like
fairly low dose UVB light exposure. hard imagine getting much damage
skin. course, sensitive skin, live area world


very, bright intense sunlight particular times year, want
cautious. Heed warnings considerations sunscreen talked
earlier, wearing hat. point clear. us getting
UVB exposure sunlight. can already hear screams within comments
rather questions within comments, saying,

01:12:48 Tools: Sunlight (UVB), Blue-Light Blockers, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

"Well, live part world don't get much UVB exposure?"
want emphasize something also emphasized many discussions
podcast related sleep circadian rhythms alertness, even cloud-
covered day, going get far light energy, photons cloud cover
going get indoor light source, artificial light source. can't
emphasize enough. look outside morning see sunlight,
see sunlight throughout day, great favor try
chase sunlight get sunlight expose eyes skin
sunlight much safely can. say much safely can,
never ever look light, artificial, sunlight, otherwise, bright
painful look at. fine get light arriving eyes indirectly. fine wear
eyeglasses contact lenses. fact, think biology eye
way lenses work, will just serve focus light onto cells
want light beams delivered to, whereas sunglasses highly
reflective trying get sunlight exposure windshield car
window simply won't work. sorry tell you, windows designed filter
UVB light. somebody really keen blue blockers
wearing blue blockers day, well, don't wear outside. fact,
probably disservice wearing morning daytime.
certainly place blue blockers evening nighttime,
issues falling staying asleep. think it, blue blockers,
really blocking short wavelength, UVB wavelengths light
desperately need arrive retina course, also onto skin
order get powerful biological effects hormones pain reduction.
terms skin exposure, data also might make think little bit whether
not wear short sleeves long sleeves, whether not want wear


shorts skirt pants. going depend context life social
variables important, course. don't know every one
circumstances, can't tell X Y Z, I, might take
consideration total amount skin exposure going allow
capture fewer photons, depending on, instance, completely cloaked
clothing just exposed hands, neck, face now,
whether not outside shorts T-shirt, going get very,
different patterns biological signaling activation two circumstances. Many
guessing wondering whether not seek UVB exposure
throughout entire year summer months. sort going
depend whether not experience depression winter months, called
seasonal effective disorder. people mild, people severe forms
seasonal effective disorder. people love fall winter shorter days.
love bundling up. love leaves. love snow, love cold,
don't experience psychological lows. varies tremendously.
genetic differences birthplace origin differences relate this, really
considered case-by-case basis. personally believe, reinforced
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health,
Samer Hattar, well get UVB exposure sunlight
throughout entire year, provided aren't burning skin damaging eyes
way. addition that, winter months, experience drop
energy increase depression psychological lows, can beneficial
access SAD lamp. don't want buy SAD lamp, 'cause oftentimes can
expensive, might well simply get LED lighting panel. described
one before. want emphasize no affiliation whatsoever
commercial sources, described one describe again. can
provide link couple examples show, show note captions,
excuse me. 930 1,000 lux, L-U-X, light source designed drawing.
literally drawing box. thin panel. size laptop.
inexpensive compared typical SAD lamp. actually one, position

sunlight early morning several times throughout day. particularly
overcast outside just doesn't seem lot sunlight coming
clouds, will try look light source little bit day order trigger
mechanisms. Now, people may desire get UVB exposure skin
want sources sunlight. little bit
complicated. are, course, tanning salons, basically beds UVB light.
really are. never one. know people frequent
certain parts world. There, course, people covering eyes.
getting UVB exposure skin, typically UVB exposure,

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway

that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway

psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person

that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light

readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens

talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments

01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-
level Light Therapy Skin: Stimulating, Healing, Restoring.
interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole
body illumination infrared saunas really point specific mechanistically


supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670
nanometers. 670 nanometers appear red me. They,
that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not

amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones
red cones. just red cones absorb light best. important
takeaway viewing red light near-infrared light distance

wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore
function cells well. little bit studies Jeffery Lab.
One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-

started using protocol. older 40 years old. also
experimenting red light panels way addressing changes
biological tissues, blood work, et cetera. going talk
future episode, that, course, call anecdata. relates
experience. today, certainly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively, talking anecdata
highlighting anecdata. somebody wants explore red light

red light 670 nanometers wavelength near-infrared light 790
nanometers wavelength effective wavelengths
complimentary. probably why, maybe just coincidental, fortunate
coincidence lot commercially available red light panels find
combine red light near-infrared light. However, want emphasize
panels commercially available going bright safely
look close up. fact, red light panels designed

actually designed shield red light. take potential dangers
excessive illumination eyes wavelength light seriously.
going explore 670 790 nanometer light sake enhancing neuronal function,

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different

increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred

02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain

improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical

brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et

short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns

01:06:13 Light & Improved Pain Tolerance

summer months, provided can without damaging skin. Another set
impressive effects UVB light, whether not comes sunlight
artificial source, effect UVB light tolerance pain. turns
tolerance pain varies across year pain tolerance increased
longer day conditions. saw effects UVB hormones mating,


again, occurring via UVB exposure skin UVB exposure eyes.
want just describe two studies really capture essence results.
going discuss kind top contour fashion. won't go quite much
depth last study, will provide links studies well. first
study entitled Skin Exposure Ultraviolet B Rapidly Activates Systemic,
Neuroendocrine, Immunosuppressive Responses. might hear
think, "Oh, immunosuppressive bad." basically observed even
one exposure UVB light changed output particular hormones
neurochemicals body, corticotropin hormone beta-endorphins,
endogenous opioids. heard opioid crisis, people
getting addicted opioids taking drug form, pharmaceuticals.
referring endorphins body naturally manufactures releases order
counter pain act somewhat psychological soother also, because, course,
physical pain emotional pain intimately linked brain body.
found exposure UVB light increased release beta-endorphins.
caused essentially release endogenous pain killer. Now, second study
came recently, just last week, fact, published journal Neuron, Cell
Press journal, excellent journal, entitled Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal
Gray Area Antinociceptive Effects Bright Light Treatment. translate little bit
you. periaqueductal gray region mid-brain contains lot
neurons can release endogenous opioids, things like beta-enkephalin, things like
enkephalin, things like mu opioid. names chemicals body can
manufacture act endogenous pain killers increase tolerance pain.
actually make feel less pain overall shutting neurons
perceive pain reducing activity. Not dangerous level, right? not
going block pain response burn unnecessarily harm
unnecessarily, act bit pain killer inside. heard
word antinociceptive, nociception basically perception way neurons
respond painful stimuli. can think nociceptive events nervous system
painful events. using broad brush. realized experts pain
will say, "Oh, not really pain circuit," et cetera, et cetera. sake today's
discussion, fair say nociception perception pain. title
Visual Circuit Related Periaqueductal Gray, area releases
endogenous opioids antinociceptive, anti-pain effects bright light treatment,


key finding study light landing eyes captured
specific cells talking earlier, intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin
ganglion cells long name them, particular neurons eye,
eye incidentally, communicate particular brain areas. brain areas
names. want know them, aficionados ultra curious folks,
names like ventral lateral geniculate nucleus intergeniculate
leaflet. names don't matter. point light landing eyes captured
melanopsin cells. absorb light, translate light electrical signals
handed off areas brain, ventral geniculate.
ventral geniculate communicates periaqueductal gray area evoke release
endogenous opioids soothe lead less perception pain.
really important study long known longer days bright light
environments, tolerate emotional physical pain better. Previous studies
shown light landing skin mediates effect, part.
couldn't explain entire effect. recent study indicates also light
arriving eyes, case, again, UVB light, ultraviolet blue light sort
comes sunlight, triggering anti-pain pain-relieving pathways.
again, two parallel pathways. theme going hear
again, not just episode, episodes Huberman
Lab Podcast, way brain body built. Nature rarely
relies one mechanism order create important phenomenon, pain relief
important phenomenon. now least two examples potent effects
UVB light exposure skin eyes. One involving activation
testosterone estrogen pathways, relates mating, another relates

thinking tools protocols, somebody experiencing chronic pain,
provided can safely, try get UVB exposure, ideally sunlight. think
20 30-minute protocol, two three times per week excellent one, seems like
fairly low dose UVB light exposure. hard imagine getting much damage

rather questions within comments, saying,

01:12:48 Tools: Sunlight (UVB), Blue-Light Blockers, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

"Well, live part world don't get much UVB exposure?"
want emphasize something also emphasized many discussions
podcast related sleep circadian rhythms alertness, even cloud-
covered day, going get far light energy, photons cloud cover
going get indoor light source, artificial light source. can't
emphasize enough. look outside morning see sunlight,
see sunlight throughout day, great favor try
chase sunlight get sunlight expose eyes skin
sunlight much safely can. say much safely can,
never ever look light, artificial, sunlight, otherwise, bright
painful look at. fine get light arriving eyes indirectly. fine wear

UVB light. somebody really keen blue blockers
wearing blue blockers day, well, don't wear outside. fact,
probably disservice wearing morning daytime.
certainly place blue blockers evening nighttime,
issues falling staying asleep. think it, blue blockers,
really blocking short wavelength, UVB wavelengths light
desperately need arrive retina course, also onto skin
order get powerful biological effects hormones pain reduction.
terms skin exposure, data also might make think little bit whether
not wear short sleeves long sleeves, whether not want wear


shorts skirt pants. going depend context life social
variables important, course. don't know every one
circumstances, can't tell X Y Z, I, might take
consideration total amount skin exposure going allow
capture fewer photons, depending on, instance, completely cloaked

whether not outside shorts T-shirt, going get very,
different patterns biological signaling activation two circumstances. Many
guessing wondering whether not seek UVB exposure
throughout entire year summer months. sort going
depend whether not experience depression winter months, called
seasonal effective disorder. people mild, people severe forms
seasonal effective disorder. people love fall winter shorter days.
love bundling up. love leaves. love snow, love cold,
don't experience psychological lows. varies tremendously.
genetic differences birthplace origin differences relate this, really
considered case-by-case basis. personally believe, reinforced

want sources sunlight. little bit
complicated. are, course, tanning salons, basically beds UVB light.
really are. never one. know people frequent
certain parts world. There, course, people covering eyes.
getting UVB exposure skin, typically UVB exposure,
intensities rather, tend very, high. can actually damage eyes.
looking very, bright artificial UVB source close. really
explore options yourself. Sunlight course, original still
best way get UVB exposure. without knowing particular circumstances,
finances, genetics, place origin, et cetera, can't know whether not need
use artificial sources. going gauge that. Meanwhile, getting outside,
looking getting exposure UVB onto skin going beneficial
vast majority people there. fact, even going beneficial
people blind. People blind, provided still eyes, often maintain
melanopsin cells. even low vision no vision, getting UVB exposure
eyes can beneficial sake mood, hormone pathways, pain reduction,
forth. cautionary note, people retinitis pigmentosa, macular

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger

light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian

circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared

referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function

never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive

goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged

including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright

hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short

meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long

light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number

actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal

may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense

used long time, can basically point phone particular light

dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin

well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens

UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim

perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux

sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart

increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose

indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function

get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual

always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.

01:26:18 Light Therapies: Local vs. Systemic Exposure

will help heal scars, mechanistic basis light effects makes
total sense. consider, however, particular light therapy
considering involves local application rather illuminating broad
swaths skin, no involvement eyes, meaning no delivery
UVB red light light therapy eyes, probably not going
potent treatment systemic activation larger areas skin
eyes. Now, again, cautionary note, don't want people taking technologies
designed local application beaming eyes. very,
bad damaging retinal tissues. Certainly, wouldn't want taking
bright light high intensity kind getting cavalier that. Typically,
local illumination say wound particular patch acne form skin
treatment involves high intensity light. intensity high, can
actually damage skin. talk moments,

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light

before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either

12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan

turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim

perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart

indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized

don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:26:18 Light Therapies: Local vs. Systemic Exposure

will help heal scars, mechanistic basis light effects makes
total sense. consider, however, particular light therapy
considering involves local application rather illuminating broad
swaths skin, no involvement eyes, meaning no delivery
UVB red light light therapy eyes, probably not going
potent treatment systemic activation larger areas skin
eyes. Now, again, cautionary note, don't want people taking technologies
designed local application beaming eyes. very,
bad damaging retinal tissues. Certainly, wouldn't want taking
bright light high intensity kind getting cavalier that. Typically,
local illumination say wound particular patch acne form skin
treatment involves high intensity light. intensity high, can
actually damage skin. talk moments,
therapies modifying skin involve actually burning off small, thin layer top
epidermis efforts trigger renewal activation stem cells will
replenish new cells. fine line light therapies
localized intense, designed damage skin cause
reactivation new stem cells, whether hair cells skin cells, et cetera, versus
systemic activation across broad swaths skin eyes. really
consider case-by-case basis, least now just consider increases
hormones, reduction pain way increases enkephalin endogenous
opioids, improving immune status activating spleen, on, really
downstream consequence illuminating large swaths skin making
sure neurons within eye get adequate UVB exposure light

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim
condition three lux somewhat dim condition hundred lux not actually
perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart
rate variability. saw increases heart rate, decreases heart rate variability,
increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose
management suffering. powerful. results study essentially
indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even
fall asleep sleep whole night through, room sleeping
many lux, much light energy, light energy no doubt going

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized

questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function

never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive

goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce

01:28:54 Tool: Improving Mood, Timing Natural & Artificial Light

combined local treatments likely ones
success. Now, like shift attention effects light mood
specifically. talked terms seasonal effective disorder, many us
don't suffer seasonal effective disorder. like drill little deeper
light impacts mood. here, want to, again, paraphrase statements Dr. Samer
Hattar National Institutes Mental Health, mention director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health perhaps one top
one two three world experts light can impact mood, appetite, circadian
rhythms, forth. Samer stated podcast, said various venues
well, getting much UVB light eyes skin early day
throughout day safely possible going beneficial mood. also
another time day, rather say time night UVB can leveraged
order improve mood, actually inverse everything talking
now. particular neural circuit originates
melanopsin cells eye bypass areas brain associated
circadian clocks, everything related sleep wakefulness, specifically
dedicated pathways involving release molecules like dopamine,
neuromodulator associated motivation, feeling good, feeling like
possibility world, forth, molecules well,
including serotonin endogenous opioids talked before.
particular pathway involves brain structure called perihabenular nucleus.
perihabenular nucleus gets input cells eye respond UVB light,
frankly, bright light wavelengths well, 'cause recall, light bright
enough, even not UV blue light, can activate cells eye. cells
eye communicate perihabenular nucleus. turns out, pathway
activated wrong time 24-hour cycle, mood gets worse, dopamine output
gets worse, molecules specifically make us feel good, actually
reduced output. UVB exposure morning throughout day
going important elevating maintaining elevated mood, avoiding UVB
light night actually way can prevent activation eye
perihabenular pathway can actually turn depression. direct


succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim
condition three lux somewhat dim condition hundred lux not actually
perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart
rate variability. saw increases heart rate, decreases heart rate variability,
increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose
management suffering. powerful. results study essentially
indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even
fall asleep sleep whole night through, room sleeping
many lux, much light energy, light energy no doubt going
eyelids, can, activating particular cells eye trigger increase
sympathetic nervous system activation disrupting metabolism. study
rests number recent studies published Cell, superb journal,
journals, showing course healthy, deep night's sleep,
body actually transitions various forms metabolic function. actually
experience ketosis-like states. experience glucogenesis. experience different
forms metabolism associated different stages sleep, not something
going depth podcast, will future podcast. study shows
light exposure even sleep disrupting autonomic, case,
sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system ways disrupting
metabolism, probably sleep, certainly outside sleep wake
first meal day. even intermittent fasting, eat first
meal day, sleep taking place environment

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-
level Light Therapy Skin: Stimulating, Healing, Restoring.
interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole
body illumination infrared saunas really point specific mechanistically


supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either

40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage

neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths

wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels

neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,

succinct this, avoid exposure UVB light artificial sources
hours 10:00 pm 4:00 am. somebody suffers low mood
overall kind mild depression even severe depression, course, please see
psychiatrist, see trained psychologist, get treated, especially well
avoid UVB exposure artificial sources, not just 10:00 pm 4:00 am,
really careful getting much exposure UVB even late evening,
8:00 pm perhaps 4:00 am. can't emphasize enough, view UVB light,
activate neurons eye potently. cells communicate
perihabenular nucleus, do, will truncate reduce amount
dopamine release. want keep mood elevated, get lot light,
UVB light, throughout day,

01:32:44 Light Conditions & Sleep Optimization

night, really cautious getting UVB exposure artificial sources. Now
say somebody no issues mood. just happiest person
year long, maybe just subtle variations mood. feel great
that. Turns still want careful light exposure
hours 10:00 pm so, 4:00 am, fact, even sleep. recent
study just came Proceedings National Academy Sciences,
entitled Light Exposure Sleep Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
interesting study took human subjects, young adults,
sleep rooms different lighting conditions, either dim light slightly bright light.
Now, many people can't fall asleep brightly lit rooms, acknowledge this.
not brightly lit rooms. rooms just little bit overhead
room lighting, hundred lux, not bright all. sleep
room dim light, less three lux. want get sense
bright three lux versus hundred lux, encourage download free
app Light Meter. no relationship app. pretty cool app, however.
used long time, can basically point phone particular light
source, sun otherwise, just press button it'll give approximate
readout lux, light intensity phone happens staring
location. not exact, pretty good back-of-the-envelope measure light
intensity. subjects either sleeping dim room, three lux very,


dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim
condition three lux somewhat dim condition hundred lux not actually
perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart
rate variability. saw increases heart rate, decreases heart rate variability,
increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose
management suffering. powerful. results study essentially
indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even
fall asleep sleep whole night through, room sleeping
many lux, much light energy, light energy no doubt going

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole
body illumination infrared saunas really point specific mechanistically


supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved

always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage

neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less

work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red

wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain

forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical

also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts

dim, somewhat dim room, hundred lux. study, measured things
like melatonin levels. looked heart rate, looked measures insulin
glucose management. Now, previous episodes, talked glucose, blood
sugar, regulated insulin don't want glucose levels high,
hyperglycemia, low, hypoglycemia. hormone insulin involved
sequestering shuttling glucose bloodstream. Basically, well manage
glucose bloodstream can indirectly measured insulin levels.
well known sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation insulin. However,
study, subjects sleeping whole night through. just happens
subjects sleeping dimly lit room, three lux, subjects
sleeping somewhat dimly lit room, hundred lux. incredible
study rooms sufficiently dimmed melatonin levels not altered
either case. really key. not one group experienced lot bright light
eyelids others not. Melatonin levels not disrupted. given
potently light can inhibit melatonin, speaks fact dim
condition three lux somewhat dim condition hundred lux not actually
perceived subjects disrupting hormone pathways. also
looked glucose responses. people essentially take fasting glucose test
different conditions. won't go details, found. healthy
adults, even just one night sleeping moderately lit environment, hundred lux
environment, caused changes, increases nighttime heart rate, means
sympathetic nervous system overly active compared people slept
completely dark very, dimly lit room. Decreases heart rate variability,
point heart rate variability HRV good thing, want heart
rate variability. saw increases heart rate, decreases heart rate variability,
increases next morning insulin resistance, indication glucose
management suffering. powerful. results study essentially
indicate even just one night sleeping whole night dimly lit
environment disrupting way autonomic nervous system functioning,
altering called autonomic tone, making us less relaxed probably best way
describe it, even though asleep, disrupting way cardiometabolic
function operates, lower heart rate variability increased insulin
resistance. not good thing us experience. mainly
talking positive effects UVB light forms light, now


two examples. One work Hattar colleagues showing UVB exposure
via perihabenula can diminish output dopamine molecules
make us feel good UVB exposure middle night late evening.
now yet another study performed, case, humans, indicating even
fall asleep sleep whole night through, room sleeping
many lux, much light energy, light energy no doubt going
eyelids, can, activating particular cells eye trigger increase
sympathetic nervous system activation disrupting metabolism. study
rests number recent studies published Cell, superb journal,
journals, showing course healthy, deep night's sleep,
body actually transitions various forms metabolic function. actually
experience ketosis-like states. experience glucogenesis. experience different
forms metabolism associated different stages sleep, not something
going depth podcast, will future podcast. study shows
light exposure even sleep disrupting autonomic, case,
sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system ways disrupting
metabolism, probably sleep, certainly outside sleep wake
first meal day. even intermittent fasting, eat first
meal day, sleep taking place environment

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-
level Light Therapy Skin: Stimulating, Healing, Restoring.
interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole
body illumination infrared saunas really point specific mechanistically


supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670
nanometers. 670 nanometers appear red me. They,
that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not
cells responsible moving mouth. rods cones neural
retina responsible using amount ATP energy entire
body. that, cells tend accumulate lot reactive oxygen
species age. Red light sort used studies able reduce
amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones
red cones. just red cones absorb light best. important
takeaway viewing red light near-infrared light distance
safe just couple minutes day allowed reversal aging process
neurons, people heard say before, just say again,
retina, including photoreceptors, not just connected brain.
not just near brain. actual central nervous system tissue.
two pieces brain, meaning neuroretinas two pieces


brain reside outside skull, least outside cranial vault.
seeing reversal aging process neurons shining red light neurons.
Now, course, Jeffery Lab primarily interested vision, humans
dependent vision sense navigate world survive. really
wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore
function cells well. little bit studies Jeffery Lab.
One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-
infrared light one use. don't affiliation companies products
promote make red light therapies. red light panel, confess


started using protocol. older 40 years old. also
experimenting red light panels way addressing changes
biological tissues, blood work, et cetera. going talk
future episode, that, course, call anecdata. relates
experience. today, certainly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively, talking anecdata
highlighting anecdata. somebody wants explore red light
therapy, need do. need make sure red light source,
whatever source happen use, whether not purchase make one...
fact, red light sources very, easy make. essentially take
bright flashlight cover film filter allow particular long
wavelengths pass through. easy look online figure
this. probably for, know, just dollars
purchase red light unit within budget something
interested in. want make sure not bright damaging
eye. good rule thumb something isn't painful look at. fact,
just emphasize time look light source, sunlight otherwise,
painful makes want squint close eyes, means bright
look without closing eyes. Okay, sort duh, loathe think
anyone harm bright light way. don't just say
protect us. say protect you, course, responsible
health. again, retinal neurons not regenerate. gone dead,
not come back. no technology replace current state
time. please don't damage retinas. red light source safe look
not painful look at? Chances is. yet still encourage talk
optometrist ophthalmologist getting extensive protocols.
still determined pursue sorts protocols Jeffery studies,
certainly provide link studies. Again, involved looking red light
panels, blinking aloud two minutes three minutes every morning period two
weeks more. older 40, well effect.
longer, younger 40, excuse me, unlikely effect. least
observed particular studies. lights not flashing.
continuous illumination. Again, allowed blink. not even direct
illumination. can somewhat indirect illumination, much described use


UVB light before. wavelength light important. red light near-infrared
light going effective scenario. authors study emphasized
red light 670 nanometers wavelength near-infrared light 790
nanometers wavelength effective wavelengths
complimentary. probably why, maybe just coincidental, fortunate
coincidence lot commercially available red light panels find
combine red light near-infrared light. However, want emphasize
panels commercially available going bright safely
look close up. fact, red light panels designed
illumination skin oftentimes arrive packaging eye protectors
actually designed shield red light. take potential dangers
excessive illumination eyes wavelength light seriously.
going explore 670 790 nanometer light sake enhancing neuronal function,
set distance comfortable look at, doesn't force squint
doesn't make feel uncomfortable physically, need turn away
period two three-minute illumination day. terms turning away
light, just briefly mention not accident coincidence
response bright light. so-called photic avoidance pathway
involves cells within retina, ganglion cells communicate yet another
brain station, certain area thalamus communicate areas brain

desire squint turn away. can useful guide terms gauging
bright light

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels



02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive

creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce

that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections

number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,
phototherapy different sort talking now.
phototherapy designed trigger activation biological pathways far away

talking earlier, illumination skin UVB light setting off
enormous number different cascades different organs tissues, including
spleen, testes, ovaries, on. again, light powerful effects,
locally cells light delivered to, also systemically terms
cells changing electrical chemical outputs, modifying lots lots
biological programs. actionable tool related studies yet? Well,


sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,
staring flickering light given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
might surprise you, shouldn't, study illustrates
anyone ever night club something illustrates, look
strobe light, instance, whole world visual perception changes, actually,
rhythm perceive music, perceive conversation,
perceive movement body actually changes according patterns
visual flicker, cases, strobe, using sort club dancing example.
brain training outside environment. given power flickering lights
entrain brain rhythms, think stage, probably preliminary really suggest
specific protocol, definitely keep eye sorts studies.
coming time. think short period, going see
specific protocols one use even home, course, non-

offsetting neurodegeneration, also enhancing focus,

02:19:07 Phototherapies Health

enhancing transition sleep, brain states well. Today, covered
say lot information. goal give understanding

well. realize even though lot information, many aspects
phototherapy not cover. know lot interest nowadays, instance,
use red light wavelength light therapies ovarian health
testicular health. fact, get lot questions as, can red light used improve
testosterone output? so, best accomplished shining red light skin
directly gonads, testicles? going cover data future time.
Right now, studies done rodents, don't think easily enough


translated humans. studies happening humans now exciting
sense hold lot potential, data aren't clear yet. However, data
using UVB skin men women order increase hormone, particular
testosterone estrogen output, data, think, exciting

01:39:00 Infrared Light, Skin & Wound Healing

overly illuminated, well, disrupting cardiac function
metabolism. talking lot UVB light, short wavelength light.
UV light, blue light, maybe even blue green light, going short
wavelength light. Now, like shift attention end spectrum,
meaning light spectrum, talk red light infrared light, long
wavelength light. Many so-called low level light therapies, acronym LLLT, low level
light therapies, involve use red light infrared light. Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve use UVB, often not days, hear
LLLT, low level light therapy, referring red light near-infrared light therapies.
Low level light therapies shown effective huge number
biological phenomenon medical treatments. can't summarize now.
take many, many hours. effective episode curing insomnia,


wouldn't inform properly use light health. Rather, like
just emphasize top contour studies point instance,
low level light therapy infrared light shown effective treatment
acne sorts skin lesions. really nice studies
actually use subjects internal control. people, believe
not, agreed half face illuminated red light near-infrared light,
half face serve control, several weeks time.
can see pretty impressive reductions skin lesions, reductions scars
acne, reduction acne lesions themselves, meaning accumulation new acne
cysts low level light therapy, using red light infrared light. Sometimes however,
resistance acne low level light therapy, people will get
initial improvement, it'll go away despite continuing treatment.
probably asking, least asking, shining red light
skin can impact things like acne wound healing, et cetera? Well, understand that,
think back beginning episode described long
wavelength light, red light near-infrared light, even longer red
light, can pass certain surfaces, including skin. skin
epidermis, outside, dermis, deeper layers. Red
light infrared light can pass deeper layers skin, can
change metabolic function particular cells. just take acne example.
Within dermis, deep layers skin, called sebaceous
glands actually make oil present skin. sebaceous glands
often nearby hair follicles. ever infected hair follicle, not
coincidence hair follicles tend get infected. Part actually
portal around hair follicle, sebaceous gland oil
created. going give rise to, instance, acne lesions. Also, dermis,
deep layers skin, melanocytes. not just epidermis,
also deeper layers skin. stem cells give rise
additional skin cells. top layers epidermis damaged, stem cells can
become activated. also stem cells give rise hair follicles.
shining red light near-infrared light localized patch skin, provided red light
not high intensity burns skin, sufficient intensity
provides just little bit damage upper layers skin, epidermis,
triggers certain biological pathways within cells sebaceous gland


stem cells within hair cell niche stem cells skin, happens top
layers skin basically burned off low level burn and/or cells
deeper layer start churn new cells, go rescue lesion, essentially
clear lesion replace lesion healthy skin cells. work
context wound healing, getting scars disappear. also works remove certain
patches pigmentation. sometimes cases people will get red
blotchiness due certain skin conditions darker pigmentation want
remove, need removed, potential skin cancer threat. Now,
red light actually within cells sebaceous gland, stem cells,
et cetera? Well, long wavelength light can actually get deep skin, mentioned
before, can also get individual cells can access so-called
organelles, described beginning episode. particular, can
access mitochondria, responsible producing ATP. Now, simple way
think sake discussion cells age, particular,
metabolically active cells, accumulate called ROSs, reactive oxygen
species. reactive oxygen species go up, ATP energy production cells
tends go down. general statement, general statement
cases true. minor exceptions don't concern us
cell types different ones talking now. way think
red light passes deeper layers skin, activates
mitochondria, increases ATP, directly indirectly reduces reactive
oxygen species. reactive oxygen species not good. don't want them.
cause cellular damage, cellular death. part just inhibit way
cells work. heard red light near-infrared light therapies designed heal
skin improve skin quality remove lesions, get rid scars unwanted
pigmentation, not pseudoscience, not woo science. grounded
biology light interacts mitochondria reactive oxygen species.
may also find interesting note cream-based treatments
acne, instance, like retinoic acid, Retin-A, actually derivative vitamin A.
pathway involving retinoic acid vitamin A, believe not, similar
natural biological pathway photopigments eye convert light information
biological changes within cells. key point light activating
particular pathways cells can either drive death cells can make cells
essentially younger



01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-
level Light Therapy Skin: Stimulating, Healing, Restoring.
interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole
body illumination infrared saunas really point specific mechanistically


supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670
nanometers. 670 nanometers appear red me. They,
that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not
cells responsible moving mouth. rods cones neural
retina responsible using amount ATP energy entire
body. that, cells tend accumulate lot reactive oxygen
species age. Red light sort used studies able reduce
amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones
red cones. just red cones absorb light best. important
takeaway viewing red light near-infrared light distance
safe just couple minutes day allowed reversal aging process
neurons, people heard say before, just say again,
retina, including photoreceptors, not just connected brain.
not just near brain. actual central nervous system tissue.
two pieces brain, meaning neuroretinas two pieces


brain reside outside skull, least outside cranial vault.
seeing reversal aging process neurons shining red light neurons.
Now, course, Jeffery Lab primarily interested vision, humans
dependent vision sense navigate world survive. really
wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore
function cells well. little bit studies Jeffery Lab.
One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-
infrared light one use. don't affiliation companies products
promote make red light therapies. red light panel, confess


started using protocol. older 40 years old. also
experimenting red light panels way addressing changes
biological tissues, blood work, et cetera. going talk
future episode, that, course, call anecdata. relates
experience. today, certainly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively, talking anecdata
highlighting anecdata. somebody wants explore red light
therapy, need do. need make sure red light source,
whatever source happen use, whether not purchase make one...
fact, red light sources very, easy make. essentially take
bright flashlight cover film filter allow particular long
wavelengths pass through. easy look online figure
this. probably for, know, just dollars
purchase red light unit within budget something
interested in. want make sure not bright damaging
eye. good rule thumb something isn't painful look at. fact,
just emphasize time look light source, sunlight otherwise,
painful makes want squint close eyes, means bright
look without closing eyes. Okay, sort duh, loathe think
anyone harm bright light way. don't just say
protect us. say protect you, course, responsible

not come back. no technology replace current state
time. please don't damage retinas. red light source safe look
not painful look at? Chances is. yet still encourage talk
optometrist ophthalmologist getting extensive protocols.
still determined pursue sorts protocols Jeffery studies,
certainly provide link studies. Again, involved looking red light
panels, blinking aloud two minutes three minutes every morning period two
weeks more. older 40, well effect.
longer, younger 40, excuse me, unlikely effect. least
observed particular studies. lights not flashing.
continuous illumination. Again, allowed blink. not even direct
illumination. can somewhat indirect illumination, much described use


UVB light before. wavelength light important. red light near-infrared
light going effective scenario. authors study emphasized
red light 670 nanometers wavelength near-infrared light 790
nanometers wavelength effective wavelengths
complimentary. probably why, maybe just coincidental, fortunate
coincidence lot commercially available red light panels find
combine red light near-infrared light. However, want emphasize
panels commercially available going bright safely
look close up. fact, red light panels designed
illumination skin oftentimes arrive packaging eye protectors
actually designed shield red light. take potential dangers
excessive illumination eyes wavelength light seriously.
going explore 670 790 nanometer light sake enhancing neuronal function,
set distance comfortable look at, doesn't force squint
doesn't make feel uncomfortable physically, need turn away
period two three-minute illumination day. terms turning away
light, just briefly mention not accident coincidence
response bright light. so-called photic avoidance pathway
involves cells within retina, ganglion cells communicate yet another
brain station, certain area thalamus communicate areas brain

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels



02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive

sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,
staring flickering light given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
might surprise you, shouldn't, study illustrates
anyone ever night club something illustrates, look

all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred

able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive

improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz

01:46:00 Infrared Light Therapy & Skin, Low-Level Laser (Light) Therapy (LLLT)

increasing ATP way improving mitochondrial function. recent years,
just beautiful examples exist, not realm skin biology,
realm neurobiology whereby red light near-infrared light can actually
used enhance function cells that, instance, allow us see better
indeed cells allow us think better. now like review data
not interesting right, also point
interesting powerful application low-cost zero-cost tools can use
improve vision. somebody interested use red light near-
infrared light, so-called LLLT, low level light therapies, treatment dermatologic
issues, anything related skin, will include link excellent set reviews.
first one Light-emitting Diodes Dermatology: Systematic Review Randomized
Controlled Trials. one includes review large number studies, came
just years ago 2018, think clearly cleanly laid anyone
access. can see degree effects red light, instance, treatment
acne scarring, et cetera. also provide link another review, Low-

interested, again, dermatologic issues kind restoring youthfulness
kind general themes anti-aging longevity red light therapies can
used that, encourage take look reviews.
going find rarely, ever, study looking whole body red light
illumination sake treating improving skin. mention get lot
questions infrared sauna global illumination red lights. talk
cases global illumination whole body whole face red
lights might useful, terms infrared sauna, mentioned podcast
before, will certainly go deeper upcoming episode, use
heat temperature augmenting biology, general, infrared saunas don't
get hot enough, temperature-wise, order trigger important effects
growth hormone heat shock proteins things sauna
shown excellent for. general statement. realize
infrared saunas get hot enough. data use whole

supported effects. Almost positive effects going see red light
low-level light therapies, certainly ones discussed reviews just
mentioned, going consequence directed illumination particular
patches skin seeking repair, people seeking repair of. again,
don't want disparage infrared saunas, general, don't get hot enough
trigger positive effects sauna demonstrated have.
unclear whether not can enhance skin quality, youthfulness, restore
top layers skin damaged, repair acne, et cetera.

01:49:20 Infrared Light & Age-Related Vision Loss

heat saunas infrared saunas comparison upcoming
episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670

that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not

retina responsible using amount ATP energy entire
body. that, cells tend accumulate lot reactive oxygen
species age. Red light sort used studies able reduce
amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

episode. talk clear set examples red light near-infrared
light shown positive effects health. data
referred beginning episode Dr. Glen Jeffery University College
London, who, again, longstanding member neuroscience community, working
visual neuroscience, last decade really emphasized
exploration red light near-infrared light restoration neuronal function
age. absolutely critical. know don't accumulate many new brain cells
get older. areas nervous system, neural retina,
part eye, responsible translating light information electrical
signals can see, don't get new cells time
born. ability keep neurons healthy extremely important visual
system, extremely important hippocampus, area brain involved
memory. just mention even people don't get Alzheimer's,
always going degree age-related dementia. Sadly, nobody
cognitively sharp years die, 20 years that. just
never case. getting worse thinking, feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
question quickly getting worse. mechanism can
preserve reverse neuronal function turns immensely beneficial. Jeffery
Lab published two studies recent years humans looked directly, no pun
intended, red light near-infrared light can improve visual function. going
describe parameters studies. going describe
found, exactly. mechanistic motivation studies, again, traces back


effect light mitochondria. go little bit deeper mechanism just briefly
can frame potential protocol develop, light arrives
cells, including neurons, light can penetrate cells appropriate
wavelength. Red light can that, can get cells, can access mitochondria,
can increase ATP. general, anytime ATP thing increase energy cells,
involving thing called cytochrome c, oxidase. Anytime hear ase,
A-S-E, biology, going enzyme. involved process degrading
molecule creating another molecule, typically. ATP cytochrome c going
give ATP. Now, great thing, creates byproduct. breaks things
down, get ROSs, reactive oxygen species. reactive
oxygen species, want know, involved things like redox
signaling. reactive oxygen species actually change genes made cell.
goal treatment keep neurons cells youthful functioning
well, prevent reverse aging, going increase ATP reduce
reactive oxygen species, so, disrupt normal pathways
associated aging. Jeffery Lab approached studies
understanding mitochondria reactive oxygen species ATP work.
exquisitely simple point elegant. found
really, really exciting. people, subjects either
younger, 20s, 40 years old older, view red light 670
nanometers. 670 nanometers appear red me. They,
that, excuse me, distance safe eyes, foot away. Now,
foot away intense red light actually damaging eyes,
foot away red light low enough intensity
not damage eyes. anywhere two three
minutes per day. one study, long period time
12 weeks. study, just couple
weeks. remarkable collapse results across two
studies, found looking subjects ranging 28 years old
72 years old, major findings individuals 40 years old older,
40 72-year-old bracket, not subjects younger 40 years old,
saw improvement visual function. improvement visual function
improvement visual acuity, meaning ability resolve fine detail, using
particular measure visual function, called Tritan exam. T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan


exam, specifically addresses function so-called short wavelength cones,
ones respond green blue light, saw 22% improvement visual
acuity, landscape visual testing extremely exciting result. Okay,
think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods
cones not just among metabolically active cells entire body,
metabolically active cells entire body right, rods cones
cells demand, use energy cells body, not
skin cells, not spleen, not stomach cells. Even talk lot, not
cells responsible moving mouth. rods cones neural
retina responsible using amount ATP energy entire
body. that, cells tend accumulate lot reactive oxygen
species age. Red light sort used studies able reduce
amount reactive oxygen species rods cones rescue function
particular cone type, short wavelength medium wavelength cones,
think study, little bit surprising, red light near-
infrared light, not short wavelength light, used order create
improvement cellular function. step back little bit further, makes perfect
sense nothing specific red light sense gets
delivered red cones. red light near-infrared light absorbed
photoreceptors within eye, rods blue cones green cones
red cones. just red cones absorb light best. important
takeaway viewing red light near-infrared light distance
safe just couple minutes day allowed reversal aging process

not just near brain. actual central nervous system tissue.
two pieces brain, meaning neuroretinas two pieces


brain reside outside skull, least outside cranial vault.
seeing reversal aging process neurons shining red light neurons.
Now, course, Jeffery Lab primarily interested vision, humans
dependent vision sense navigate world survive. really
wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore
function cells well. little bit studies Jeffery Lab.
One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red
light needed happen early day, least within first three hours waking.
one that? Well, nowadays number different red light panels
different red light sources certainly fall within range red light near-
infrared light one use. don't affiliation companies products
promote make red light therapies. red light panel, confess


started using protocol. older 40 years old. also
experimenting red light panels way addressing changes
biological tissues, blood work, et cetera. going talk
future episode, that, course, call anecdata. relates
experience. today, certainly episodes Huberman Lab Podcast,
emphasize peer-reviewed studies almost exclusively, talking anecdata
highlighting anecdata. somebody wants explore red light
therapy, need do. need make sure red light source,
whatever source happen use, whether not purchase make one...
fact, red light sources very, easy make. essentially take
bright flashlight cover film filter allow particular long
wavelengths pass through. easy look online figure
this. probably for, know, just dollars
purchase red light unit within budget something
interested in. want make sure not bright damaging
eye. good rule thumb something isn't painful look at. fact,
just emphasize time look light source, sunlight otherwise,
painful makes want squint close eyes, means bright
look without closing eyes. Okay, sort duh, loathe think
anyone harm bright light way. don't just say
protect us. say protect you, course, responsible
health. again, retinal neurons not regenerate. gone dead,
not come back. no technology replace current state
time. please don't damage retinas. red light source safe look
not painful look at? Chances is. yet still encourage talk
optometrist ophthalmologist getting extensive protocols.
still determined pursue sorts protocols Jeffery studies,
certainly provide link studies. Again, involved looking red light
panels, blinking aloud two minutes three minutes every morning period two
weeks more. older 40, well effect.
longer, younger 40, excuse me, unlikely effect. least
observed particular studies. lights not flashing.
continuous illumination. Again, allowed blink. not even direct
illumination. can somewhat indirect illumination, much described use


UVB light before. wavelength light important. red light near-infrared
light going effective scenario. authors study emphasized
red light 670 nanometers wavelength near-infrared light 790
nanometers wavelength effective wavelengths
complimentary. probably why, maybe just coincidental, fortunate
coincidence lot commercially available red light panels find
combine red light near-infrared light. However, want emphasize
panels commercially available going bright safely
look close up. fact, red light panels designed
illumination skin oftentimes arrive packaging eye protectors
actually designed shield red light. take potential dangers
excessive illumination eyes wavelength light seriously.
going explore 670 790 nanometer light sake enhancing neuronal function,
set distance comfortable look at, doesn't force squint
doesn't make feel uncomfortable physically, need turn away
period two three-minute illumination day. terms turning away
light, just briefly mention not accident coincidence
response bright light. so-called photic avoidance pathway
involves cells within retina, ganglion cells communicate yet another
brain station, certain area thalamus communicate areas brain
associated pain. literally can trigger headache, can trigger
squint reflex. Biology just beautiful way. much light bad us
can damage eyes aspects body. look light
bright, eyes send signal brain gives us sort headache
desire squint turn away. can useful guide terms gauging
bright light

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels



02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive
decline. incredible, right? pattern flashing light delivered eyes
creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce
markers cause age-related cognitive decline Alzheimer's. parallel
that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections
neurons, on, on. discovered list huge
number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,
phototherapy different sort talking now.
phototherapy designed trigger activation biological pathways far away
tissue illuminated. calls mind sorts mechanisms
talking earlier, illumination skin UVB light setting off
enormous number different cascades different organs tissues, including
spleen, testes, ovaries, on. again, light powerful effects,
locally cells light delivered to, also systemically terms
cells changing electrical chemical outputs, modifying lots lots
biological programs. actionable tool related studies yet? Well,


sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,
staring flickering light given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
might surprise you, shouldn't, study illustrates
anyone ever night club something illustrates, look
strobe light, instance, whole world visual perception changes, actually,
rhythm perceive music, perceive conversation,
perceive movement body actually changes according patterns
visual flicker, cases, strobe, using sort club dancing example.
brain training outside environment. given power flickering lights
entrain brain rhythms, think stage, probably preliminary really suggest
specific protocol, definitely keep eye sorts studies.
coming time. think short period, going see
specific protocols one use even home, course, non-

02:05:22 Infrared Light Night, Shift Work

least far away bright source order safely engage
light source. studies just described, again, involve use red
light early day within three hours waking sake improving
neuronal function. Red light also shown beneficial late day
even middle night. say middle night, referring


studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels



02:08:35 Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection

timing cortisol production. yet another case red light used correctly can
beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes
along infrequently. given neuron fires, period time later fires,
period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive
decline. incredible, right? pattern flashing light delivered eyes
creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce
markers cause age-related cognitive decline Alzheimer's. parallel
that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections
neurons, on, on. discovered list huge
number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,
phototherapy different sort talking now.
phototherapy designed trigger activation biological pathways far away

talking earlier, illumination skin UVB light setting off
enormous number different cascades different organs tissues, including
spleen, testes, ovaries, on. again, light powerful effects,
locally cells light delivered to, also systemically terms
cells changing electrical chemical outputs, modifying lots lots
biological programs. actionable tool related studies yet? Well,


sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,
staring flickering light given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right?
might surprise you, shouldn't, study illustrates
anyone ever night club something illustrates, look
strobe light, instance, whole world visual perception changes, actually,

think studies improvements vision, excited see
improvement 5% 10%. 22% improvement visual acuity, even though
specific form visual testing, Tritan exam Tritan score, well,
turns significant translates real world important way.
particular, age, tend lose certain neurons within retina, don't tend
lose cones. tend lose rods. tend lose cells within retina,
including cells connect eye brain, so-called ganglion cells. Cones,
whatever reason, pretty resilient age-related loss. However, rods

wonderful. Here, looking therapy can reverse age-related vision loss,
least individuals. can imagine, study also done
cells reside outside skull can shine light directly them,
right? sure many people interested can
improve function, say, neurons brain responsible memory.
minutes, describe non-invasive applications light try restore

One things observed reduction so-called drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
Drusen little fatty deposits, little cholesterol deposits, accumulate eye
age. heard cholesterol within veins arteries can
clog veins arteries how, course, clogging veins arteries not
good thing. Well, neural retina metabolically active requires lot blood
flow. heavily vascularized, drusen special form cholesterol
accumulate eye. turns out, red light near-infrared light therapies
explored Jeffery Lab able actually reduce reverse
accumulation drusen. addition reducing reactive oxygen species, idea
mind now red light may actually reduce cholesterol deposits

01:59:36 Tools: Infrared Panels, Morning Exposure

reactive oxygen species order improve neuronal function.
results? anything results? Well, first
all, want emphasize even though studies exciting, fairly
recent. data, always, needed. additional features
studies think also important consider. First all, exposure red

beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,
colleagues. discovered particular pattern brain
activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity one so-called wavelength electrical
activity brain, not wavelengths light, wavelengths electrical activity
brain can restorative certain aspects learning memory can
actually help create molecular changes neurons lead clearance debris
even reductions age-related cognitive decline. way think brain waves
brain oscillations neurons electrically active, involves chemicals, et
cetera. can active slow, big waveforms. can think of,
know, Delta waves, meaning, can imagine wave electrical activity comes

period time even later fires. can imagine cell
active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. can imagine firing often, going
short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps firing. firing seldom,
going think longer wavelength firing. Turns gamma waves
one pattern firing lead downstream metabolic functions biological
functions end clearing away debris associated aging cells
also lead molecular changes enhance kind youthfulness neurons,
speak. induce gamma oscillations within brain? Well, Li-Huei Tsai
colleagues beautifully shown delivering certain patterns light
flicker, lights going off particular frequency, brain whole starts
entrain, meaning matches particular patterns light flicker, even though
many brain areas not directly within visual system visual
pathway. studies referring several, one like
highlight entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions Offers
Neuroprotection. essentially expose subjects 40 hertz,
particular frequency illumination, eyes. light goes on, light goes off, light
goes on, light goes off frequency 40 hertz.
recorded activity neurons within brain, not just within visual areas
brain, within areas well, observed increased gamma oscillations,
meaning electrical activity brain large started match patterns
light delivered eyes. really exciting unique
different types phototherapies talking now.


patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive

creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce
markers cause age-related cognitive decline Alzheimer's. parallel
that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections
neurons, on, on. discovered list huge
number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,
phototherapy different sort talking now.
phototherapy designed trigger activation biological pathways far away

biological programs. actionable tool related studies yet? Well,


sort depends adventurous are. Right now, studies
explored context clinical trials, people Alzheimer's, dementia,
forms neurodegeneration. dangerous look 40-hertz flickering light? Well,
general, answer going no. However, prone epilepsy, instance,

studies explore use red light shift workers. know people not
working middle night, least hope not, may
time time. All-nighters studying, confess still pull all-nighters every
prepare things like podcasts deadlines. really try not to,
happens less less get older, think get disciplined and/or less
good pulling all-nighters. realize many people shift work,
work certainly past 10:00 pm. maybe taking care young children
middle night, up. case, red light can actually
beneficial. nowadays lot sources red light available just red
light bulbs. don't need panel. basically saying can
beneficial use red lights night. study like emphasize context
entitled, Red Light: Novel Non-pharmacological Intervention Promote Alertness
Shift Workers. beautiful study. explored use different wavelengths
light, blue light 460 nanometers red light dim white light, different
brightnesses, et cetera, looked things like melatonin. much light
given color intensity suppress melatonin? looked cortisol, stress hormone.
looked wakefulness, much degree given color light
increase wakefulness different hours day? takeaway study
clear. need awake late night sake shift work studying taking
care children, et cetera, red light going best choice red
light sufficiently dim, not going inhibit melatonin production, not going
increase cortisol night. Cortisol high early day, least
elevated relative times day healthy. late shifted increase
cortisol, however, 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol, well known associated
depression aspects mental health, say mental illness.
need awake night even night, red light going preferred
light source. terms bright make it, well, dim can, still
able perform activities need perform. going best
guide. provide link study well. Again, really important study
emphasized forms light, red light, provided dim, can allow
stimulate alertness light landing eyes can provide. allows
stay awake whatever work need do. not seem alter
melatonin production, good. not seem alter levels

beneficial. now, talking effects shining different
wavelengths light skin eyes downstream health
consequences illumination. However, one important goals science
medicine figure change health brain. course,
brain contained within skull, therefore can't just shine light onto outside
head expect change activity neurons deep within brain, unless
neurons linked eyes skin. turns out, even
though lot brain areas connected neural circuits
hormone circuits eye, believe not, also skin, many brain
areas not. Brain areas hippocampus, involved learning
memory, brain areas neocortex, well, areas neocortex
visual cortex indirectly linked eyes, shine light eyes, can
change activity neurons neocortex, brain areas
not directly even indirectly connected visual system, not least
immediate way. raises question change activity neurons
brain? Well, pharmacology. can take pills, can inject drugs will
change pharmacology neurons way operate fire. course,
antidepressants one instance, opioid drugs another. huge array
psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds will change levels
chemicals brain. work, many also carry side effects.
rather indirect, meaning lots different cells different areas brain
utilize chemicals. drug, instance, increase serotonin sake
improving depression will also often effect reducing certain neurons output
serotonin hippocampus cause changes appetite changes libido
forth. imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires
brain stimulating specific brain areas order activate neurons brain
areas. certainly works done experimentally done
neurosurgery exams, et cetera, involves removing piece skull. not
practical. principle, light wonderful way modulate activity neurons
deep within brain. again, skull way. Recent studies, however,
figured ways light can delivered eyes change global patterns firing


brain ways can beneficial brain. work referring
now mainly work Li-Huei Tsai MIT, Massachusetts Institute Technology,

patterns phototherapy talking now involved constant
illumination given wavelength. Here, wavelength generating patterns
illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, particular frequency.
found, instance, using pattern stimulation, way, stimulation
called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, G-E-N-U-S, gamma
entrainment using sensory stimulation, number really interesting effects. First
all, reduced so-called amyloid plaques phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques
phosphorylated tau associated Alzheimer's normal age related cognitive
decline. incredible, right? pattern flashing light delivered eyes
creates pattern neuronal firing, not just visual areas brain,
areas brain well, turn trigger molecular pathways reduce
markers cause age-related cognitive decline Alzheimer's. parallel
that, observed upregulation biological pathways lead
enhancement neuronal function, maintenance synapses, connections
neurons, on, on. discovered list huge
number biological effects, reduction bad things, speak,
improvement good biological pathways. find studies exciting because,
first all, non-invasive, right? no drilling skull.
tractable experimental sense, meaning can imagine 40 hertz
stimulation turns best stimulation protocol induce gamma
oscillations, well, great, non-invasive, fairly easy explore 50 hertz
stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, different
wavelengths light. happening now. Tsai lab labs
really starting explore full range variables can impact oscillations within
brain downstream consequences. again, phototherapy,

talking earlier, illumination skin UVB light setting off
enormous number different cascades different organs tissues, including
spleen, testes, ovaries, on. again, light powerful effects,
locally cells light delivered to, also systemically terms
