00:08:26 Mindset & Do?

Just use code, Huberman checkout. now, conversation Dr. Alia


Crum. Great here. - Great here. - Yeah, record, Alia Crum,
go Allie, correct? - correct. - Right, Dr. Allie Crum. - just Allie. -
Okay, great. Well, looking forward talking long time. Just start
off, talked lot worked lot science mindsets. define
us mindset, sort purpose serve. - course, yeah.
Mindsets described defined lot ways. define mindsets core
beliefs assumptions domain category things, orient us
particular set expectations, explanations goals. kind jargony,
[chuckles], little. can distill you. mindsets assumption
make domain. take stress, example. nature stress.
sort core belief that? mindsets studied stress,
view stresses enhancing good you, view debilitating bad you?
mindsets, core beliefs, orient thinking, change expect will
happen us stressed, explain occurrences happen
unfold stressed, also change motivation engage
stressed. mindsets many things, mindsets stress,
mindsets intelligence Carol Dweck's work shown. Mindsets food,
mindsets medicine, name it. sort distilling core assumptions
really shape orient thinking action. - heard say before,
mindsets simplify life way, constraining number things
consider. sounds like can mindsets many things as,
said. different mindsets? think many people familiar
colleague, Carol Dweck's notion growth mindset. not proficient
something, think not proficient yet.
path proficiency. examples mindsets, early
get laid down, learn parents? Maybe just flesh
bit us terms observed science life. -
Yeah, sure, think important Carol Dweck's work. lot people kind get
focused growth, motivation things, work really originated
thinking about, called implicit theories core beliefs nature
intelligence ability, right? believe baseline levels intelligence
abilities, fixed, static, set throughout rest life? believe
can grow change? Now, over-simplified generalizations
nature intelligence. reality always complex, bit


things. humans, need simplifying systems help us
understand complex reality. assumptions jumped to, oh, intelligence
fixed intelligence malleable, help us simplify complex reality,
not consequential, right? matter shaping motivation.
shown, mindset, intelligence malleable, motivated
work harder, grow intelligence. setback learning, think,
okay, something can grow learn build from.
mindset fixed, know, work harder math, don't think good
it. So, retrospect, pretty clear mindsets can affect motivation.
work expand range mindsets studying,
focused on, also understand expand range effects have.
large, focused mindsets domain health health behaviors.
mentioned mindsets stress, also looked mindsets food healthy
eating. mindset foods good you, healthy foods
disgusting depriving, mindset healthy foods indulgent
delicious? Now, variety different foods. might different
thoughts different healthy foods. generally people, least culture
West, view that, stress debilitating, healthy foods disgusting
depriving. mindsets, whether not true false, right wrong,
impact. impact, not just motivational mechanisms,
Dweck others studied, lab started reveal, also
shape physiological mechanisms changing bodies prioritize prepare
do. just two examples. Mindsets stress, mindsets food
looked at. Mindsets exercise, feel like getting enough, feel
like getting insufficient amount get health benefits seeking.
Mindsets illness. view cancer unmitigated catastrophe,
view cancer manageable perhaps even opportunity. looked mindsets
symptoms side effects. view side effects sign treatment
harmful, view side effects sign treatment working? Again,
sort core beliefs assumptions domains
categories, matter shaping, synthesizing simplifying
way thinking, also shaping paying attention to,
motivated do, potentially even bodies respond.



00:14:45 Mindsets Change Biological Responses Food

- Yeah, love talk notion power mindset shaping bodies
respond. maybe example this, share us now famous
study done milkshake study, wouldn't mind sharing major
contours study results, think extremely impressive
really speak interplay mindset physiology. - Certainly, yeah.
study ran graduate student Yale university. working
Kelly Brownell Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey done lot work really coining
term emotional intelligence, studying [mumbles]. - now president Yale,
right? - now president Yale, yes. - done well. - done well
university society. Kelly Brownell, lot
research food obesity. come previous work mindsets
exercise placebo effects exercise, sort food domain
emotions food domain. really occurred me,
simple question hadn't probed yet. was, beliefs
eating change body's physiological response food, holding constant,
objective nutrients thing. question might sound outrageous first,
really not outrageous coming place studied depth, placebo
effects. Placebo effects, medicine, least, sort robust demonstration
simply taking sugar pill, taking nothing, impression real
medication might relieve asthma, reduce blood pressure boost
immune system, can lead physiological effects even though no objective
nutrients. evidence placebo effects
drug. - Really? - clinical trial process, new drugs
medications required outperform placebo effect. lot data
placebo effect. Now, know, can get nuance there. don't lot data
comparing placebo effect nothing, important distilling mindset
effects belief effects sort natural occurring changes body. anyways,
going back question, like, right, moved medications solving
health crisis behavioral medicine solving health crisis, increase people's
exercise, get eat better. degree things influenced
mindsets beliefs them. test question, ran seemingly simple
study. done Yale center clinical translational research.


brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,

unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

Just use code, Huberman checkout. now, conversation Dr. Alia


Crum. Great here. - Great here. - Yeah, record, Alia Crum,
go Allie, correct? - correct. - Right, Dr. Allie Crum. - just Allie. -
Okay, great. Well, looking forward talking long time. Just start
off, talked lot worked lot science mindsets. define
us mindset, sort purpose serve. - course, yeah.
Mindsets described defined lot ways. define mindsets core
beliefs assumptions domain category things, orient us
particular set expectations, explanations goals. kind jargony,
[chuckles], little. can distill you. mindsets assumption
make domain. take stress, example. nature stress.
sort core belief that? mindsets studied stress,
view stresses enhancing good you, view debilitating bad you?
mindsets, core beliefs, orient thinking, change expect will
happen us stressed, explain occurrences happen
unfold stressed, also change motivation engage
stressed. mindsets many things, mindsets stress,
mindsets intelligence Carol Dweck's work shown. Mindsets food,
mindsets medicine, name it. sort distilling core assumptions
really shape orient thinking action. - heard say before,
mindsets simplify life way, constraining number things
consider. sounds like can mindsets many things as,
said. different mindsets? think many people familiar
colleague, Carol Dweck's notion growth mindset. not proficient
something, think not proficient yet.
path proficiency. examples mindsets, early
get laid down, learn parents? Maybe just flesh
bit us terms observed science life. -
Yeah, sure, think important Carol Dweck's work. lot people kind get
focused growth, motivation things, work really originated
thinking about, called implicit theories core beliefs nature
intelligence ability, right? believe baseline levels intelligence
abilities, fixed, static, set throughout rest life? believe
can grow change? Now, over-simplified generalizations
nature intelligence. reality always complex, bit


things. humans, need simplifying systems help us
understand complex reality. assumptions jumped to, oh, intelligence
fixed intelligence malleable, help us simplify complex reality,
not consequential, right? matter shaping motivation.
shown, mindset, intelligence malleable, motivated
work harder, grow intelligence. setback learning, think,
okay, something can grow learn build from.
mindset fixed, know, work harder math, don't think good
it. So, retrospect, pretty clear mindsets can affect motivation.
work expand range mindsets studying,
focused on, also understand expand range effects have.
large, focused mindsets domain health health behaviors.
mentioned mindsets stress, also looked mindsets food healthy
eating. mindset foods good you, healthy foods
disgusting depriving, mindset healthy foods indulgent
delicious? Now, variety different foods. might different
thoughts different healthy foods. generally people, least culture
West, view that, stress debilitating, healthy foods disgusting
depriving. mindsets, whether not true false, right wrong,
impact. impact, not just motivational mechanisms,
Dweck others studied, lab started reveal, also
shape physiological mechanisms changing bodies prioritize prepare
do. just two examples. Mindsets stress, mindsets food
looked at. Mindsets exercise, feel like getting enough, feel
like getting insufficient amount get health benefits seeking.
Mindsets illness. view cancer unmitigated catastrophe,
view cancer manageable perhaps even opportunity. looked mindsets
symptoms side effects. view side effects sign treatment
harmful, view side effects sign treatment working? Again,
sort core beliefs assumptions domains
categories, matter shaping, synthesizing simplifying
way thinking, also shaping paying attention to,
motivated do, potentially even bodies respond.



00:14:45 Mindsets Change Biological Responses Food

- Yeah, love talk notion power mindset shaping bodies
respond. maybe example this, share us now famous
study done milkshake study, wouldn't mind sharing major
contours study results, think extremely impressive
really speak interplay mindset physiology. - Certainly, yeah.
study ran graduate student Yale university. working
Kelly Brownell Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey done lot work really coining
term emotional intelligence, studying [mumbles]. - now president Yale,
right? - now president Yale, yes. - done well. - done well
university society. Kelly Brownell, lot
research food obesity. come previous work mindsets
exercise placebo effects exercise, sort food domain
emotions food domain. really occurred me,
simple question hadn't probed yet. was, beliefs
eating change body's physiological response food, holding constant,
objective nutrients thing. question might sound outrageous first,
really not outrageous coming place studied depth, placebo
effects. Placebo effects, medicine, least, sort robust demonstration
simply taking sugar pill, taking nothing, impression real
medication might relieve asthma, reduce blood pressure boost
immune system, can lead physiological effects even though no objective
nutrients. evidence placebo effects
drug. - Really? - clinical trial process, new drugs
medications required outperform placebo effect. lot data
placebo effect. Now, know, can get nuance there. don't lot data
comparing placebo effect nothing, important distilling mindset
effects belief effects sort natural occurring changes body. anyways,
going back question, like, right, moved medications solving
health crisis behavioral medicine solving health crisis, increase people's
exercise, get eat better. degree things influenced
mindsets beliefs them. test question, ran seemingly simple
study. done Yale center clinical translational research.


brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time

of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

Crum. Great here. - Great here. - Yeah, record, Alia Crum,
go Allie, correct? - correct. - Right, Dr. Allie Crum. - just Allie. -
Okay, great. Well, looking forward talking long time. Just start
off, talked lot worked lot science mindsets. define
us mindset, sort purpose serve. - course, yeah.
Mindsets described defined lot ways. define mindsets core
beliefs assumptions domain category things, orient us
particular set expectations, explanations goals. kind jargony,
[chuckles], little. can distill you. mindsets assumption
make domain. take stress, example. nature stress.
sort core belief that? mindsets studied stress,
view stresses enhancing good you, view debilitating bad you?
mindsets, core beliefs, orient thinking, change expect will
happen us stressed, explain occurrences happen
unfold stressed, also change motivation engage
stressed. mindsets many things, mindsets stress,
mindsets intelligence Carol Dweck's work shown. Mindsets food,
mindsets medicine, name it. sort distilling core assumptions
really shape orient thinking action. - heard say before,
mindsets simplify life way, constraining number things
consider. sounds like can mindsets many things as,
said. different mindsets? think many people familiar
colleague, Carol Dweck's notion growth mindset. not proficient
something, think not proficient yet.
path proficiency. examples mindsets, early
get laid down, learn parents? Maybe just flesh
bit us terms observed science life. -
Yeah, sure, think important Carol Dweck's work. lot people kind get
focused growth, motivation things, work really originated
thinking about, called implicit theories core beliefs nature
intelligence ability, right? believe baseline levels intelligence
abilities, fixed, static, set throughout rest life? believe
can grow change? Now, over-simplified generalizations
nature intelligence. reality always complex, bit


things. humans, need simplifying systems help us
understand complex reality. assumptions jumped to, oh, intelligence
fixed intelligence malleable, help us simplify complex reality,
not consequential, right? matter shaping motivation.
shown, mindset, intelligence malleable, motivated
work harder, grow intelligence. setback learning, think,
okay, something can grow learn build from.
mindset fixed, know, work harder math, don't think good
it. So, retrospect, pretty clear mindsets can affect motivation.
work expand range mindsets studying,
focused on, also understand expand range effects have.
large, focused mindsets domain health health behaviors.
mentioned mindsets stress, also looked mindsets food healthy
eating. mindset foods good you, healthy foods
disgusting depriving, mindset healthy foods indulgent
delicious? Now, variety different foods. might different
thoughts different healthy foods. generally people, least culture
West, view that, stress debilitating, healthy foods disgusting
depriving. mindsets, whether not true false, right wrong,
impact. impact, not just motivational mechanisms,
Dweck others studied, lab started reveal, also
shape physiological mechanisms changing bodies prioritize prepare
do. just two examples. Mindsets stress, mindsets food
looked at. Mindsets exercise, feel like getting enough, feel
like getting insufficient amount get health benefits seeking.
Mindsets illness. view cancer unmitigated catastrophe,
view cancer manageable perhaps even opportunity. looked mindsets
symptoms side effects. view side effects sign treatment
harmful, view side effects sign treatment working? Again,
sort core beliefs assumptions domains
categories, matter shaping, synthesizing simplifying
way thinking, also shaping paying attention to,
motivated do, potentially even bodies respond.



00:14:45 Mindsets Change Biological Responses Food

- Yeah, love talk notion power mindset shaping bodies
respond. maybe example this, share us now famous
study done milkshake study, wouldn't mind sharing major
contours study results, think extremely impressive
really speak interplay mindset physiology. - Certainly, yeah.
study ran graduate student Yale university. working
Kelly Brownell Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey done lot work really coining
term emotional intelligence, studying [mumbles]. - now president Yale,
right? - now president Yale, yes. - done well. - done well
university society. Kelly Brownell, lot
research food obesity. come previous work mindsets
exercise placebo effects exercise, sort food domain
emotions food domain. really occurred me,
simple question hadn't probed yet. was, beliefs
eating change body's physiological response food, holding constant,
objective nutrients thing. question might sound outrageous first,
really not outrageous coming place studied depth, placebo
effects. Placebo effects, medicine, least, sort robust demonstration
simply taking sugar pill, taking nothing, impression real
medication might relieve asthma, reduce blood pressure boost
immune system, can lead physiological effects even though no objective
nutrients. evidence placebo effects
drug. - Really? - clinical trial process, new drugs
medications required outperform placebo effect. lot data
placebo effect. Now, know, can get nuance there. don't lot data
comparing placebo effect nothing, important distilling mindset
effects belief effects sort natural occurring changes body. anyways,
going back question, like, right, moved medications solving
health crisis behavioral medicine solving health crisis, increase people's
exercise, get eat better. degree things influenced
mindsets beliefs them. test question, ran seemingly simple
study. done Yale center clinical translational research.


brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.

unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

things. humans, need simplifying systems help us
understand complex reality. assumptions jumped to, oh, intelligence
fixed intelligence malleable, help us simplify complex reality,
not consequential, right? matter shaping motivation.
shown, mindset, intelligence malleable, motivated
work harder, grow intelligence. setback learning, think,
okay, something can grow learn build from.
mindset fixed, know, work harder math, don't think good
it. So, retrospect, pretty clear mindsets can affect motivation.
work expand range mindsets studying,
focused on, also understand expand range effects have.
large, focused mindsets domain health health behaviors.
mentioned mindsets stress, also looked mindsets food healthy
eating. mindset foods good you, healthy foods
disgusting depriving, mindset healthy foods indulgent
delicious? Now, variety different foods. might different
thoughts different healthy foods. generally people, least culture
West, view that, stress debilitating, healthy foods disgusting
depriving. mindsets, whether not true false, right wrong,
impact. impact, not just motivational mechanisms,
Dweck others studied, lab started reveal, also
shape physiological mechanisms changing bodies prioritize prepare
do. just two examples. Mindsets stress, mindsets food
looked at. Mindsets exercise, feel like getting enough, feel
like getting insufficient amount get health benefits seeking.
Mindsets illness. view cancer unmitigated catastrophe,
view cancer manageable perhaps even opportunity. looked mindsets
symptoms side effects. view side effects sign treatment

sort core beliefs assumptions domains
categories, matter shaping, synthesizing simplifying
way thinking, also shaping paying attention to,
motivated do, potentially even bodies respond.



00:14:45 Mindsets Change Biological Responses Food

- Yeah, love talk notion power mindset shaping bodies
respond. maybe example this, share us now famous
study done milkshake study, wouldn't mind sharing major
contours study results, think extremely impressive
really speak interplay mindset physiology. - Certainly, yeah.
study ran graduate student Yale university. working
Kelly Brownell Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey done lot work really coining
term emotional intelligence, studying [mumbles]. - now president Yale,
right? - now president Yale, yes. - done well. - done well
university society. Kelly Brownell, lot
research food obesity. come previous work mindsets
exercise placebo effects exercise, sort food domain
emotions food domain. really occurred me,
simple question hadn't probed yet. was, beliefs
eating change body's physiological response food, holding constant,
objective nutrients thing. question might sound outrageous first,
really not outrageous coming place studied depth, placebo
effects. Placebo effects, medicine, least, sort robust demonstration
simply taking sugar pill, taking nothing, impression real
medication might relieve asthma, reduce blood pressure boost
immune system, can lead physiological effects even though no objective
nutrients. evidence placebo effects
drug. - Really? - clinical trial process, new drugs
medications required outperform placebo effect. lot data
placebo effect. Now, know, can get nuance there. don't lot data
comparing placebo effect nothing, important distilling mindset
effects belief effects sort natural occurring changes body. anyways,
going back question, like, right, moved medications solving
health crisis behavioral medicine solving health crisis, increase people's
exercise, get eat better. degree things influenced
mindsets beliefs them. test question, ran seemingly simple
study. done Yale center clinical translational research.


brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

00:14:45 Mindsets Change Biological Responses Food

- Yeah, love talk notion power mindset shaping bodies
respond. maybe example this, share us now famous
study done milkshake study, wouldn't mind sharing major
contours study results, think extremely impressive
really speak interplay mindset physiology. - Certainly, yeah.
study ran graduate student Yale university. working
Kelly Brownell Peter Salovey. Peter Salovey done lot work really coining
term emotional intelligence, studying [mumbles]. - now president Yale,
right? - now president Yale, yes. - done well. - done well
university society. Kelly Brownell, lot
research food obesity. come previous work mindsets
exercise placebo effects exercise, sort food domain
emotions food domain. really occurred me,
simple question hadn't probed yet. was, beliefs
eating change body's physiological response food, holding constant,
objective nutrients thing. question might sound outrageous first,
really not outrageous coming place studied depth, placebo
effects. Placebo effects, medicine, least, sort robust demonstration
simply taking sugar pill, taking nothing, impression real
medication might relieve asthma, reduce blood pressure boost
immune system, can lead physiological effects even though no objective
nutrients. evidence placebo effects
drug. - Really? - clinical trial process, new drugs
medications required outperform placebo effect. lot data
placebo effect. Now, know, can get nuance there. don't lot data
comparing placebo effect nothing, important distilling mindset
effects belief effects sort natural occurring changes body. anyways,
going back question, like, right, moved medications solving
health crisis behavioral medicine solving health crisis, increase people's
exercise, get eat better. degree things influenced
mindsets beliefs them. test question, ran seemingly simple
study. done Yale center clinical translational research.


brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

brought people lab impression designing different
milkshakes vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,
designed meet different metabolic needs patrons hospital, right?
So, going come in, going taste milkshakes, going
measure body's physiological response them. within subjects design.
people consuming two different milkshakes, two different time points
separated week. one time point, told consuming
really high fat, high caloric indulgent milkshake. like 620 calorie, super high fat
sugar. time point, told low fat, low calorie, sensible
sort diet shake. reality, exact shake. right middle.
like 300 calories, moderate amount fats sugars. measuring
body's gut peptide response shake. particular, looking
hormone ghrelin. know, ghrelin, medical experts call hunger hormone,
rises ghrelin signal, know, seek food. theoretically, proportion,
amount calories consume, ghrelin levels drops signaling brain. Okay,
don't need eat much anymore, can stop eating, also revving
metabolism burn nutrients just ingested. found study
that, people thought consuming high fat high calorie indulgent
milkshake, response shake, ghrelin levels dropped three-fold rate
stronger thought consuming sensible shake. So,
essentially bodies responded consumed food, even though
exact shake time points. really interesting
important two reasons, really. One was, knowledge, one first
studies show effects just believing eating something different
physiology. Lots studies shown believing eating different things
changes tastes even satisfaction fullness after. shows
metabolic physiological component. second piece really
important well. especially me, one study really transformed
way think approach eating. manner affected
physiology, somewhat counterintuitive. So, gone thinking, better
mindset eat eating healthy, right? Like, know, just
makes sense. Like placebo effects think healthy, healthy, know.
far simplistic way thinking it. fact, exact opposite
thinking eating, participants thought


eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

eating sensibly, bodies left still feeling physiologically hungry, right? Not
satiated. potentially corresponding slower metabolism forth.
So, interest maintaining losing weight, best mindset
in? mindset eating indulgently. enough food,
getting enough. least study, showed
adaptive effect ghrelin responses. - interesting. especially interesting
neuroscientist worked aspects nervous system involved
conscious perception, like vision motion color perception forth.
also, lab worked increasingly working autonomic functions
conscious detection. case, lie much something
milkshakes contained affected subconscious process, imagine
ghrelin pathway not one can decide, oh, particular piece chocolate
going really reduce ghrelin 'cause nutrient rich, opposed one,
told different piece chocolate, instance, low calories sugar free
chocolate something sort. ghrelin pathway, however, seems based
data, ghrelin pathway susceptible faults, incredible. again,
must crossover conscious thought subconscious kind
autonomic pathways. So, really remarkable. raises question just
ask,

00:22:28 Beliefs Food Matter

increasingly, involved online discussions social media, one
barbed wire topics there, generous, topic
diet nutrients best? got people strictly plant-based, got
people omnivores, got people carnivores. every
variation. intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. seems
like, group plugs particular mode eating feel works
them, whatever reason, energy wise, mentally, maybe looking blood
profiles, maybe not. feel works them, camp seems
tout health benefits great feel. mindset effects
involved there? people finding nutritional program feel brings
enrichment life, also nutrients. health really shifting
positive direction, not necessarily food constituents,


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

Crum, always, thank interest science.


community, ideas reinforcement. - Yeah, belief
right way something. think, hundred percent something
contribute. not going weigh debate. will certainly weigh on,
notion that, look going back placebo effect, right? outdated
understanding is, based randomized controlled trial,
compare drug placebo. drug works better placebo, say, great,
drug works. drug doesn't outperform placebo, say drug doesn't
work. really simplified. good test specific efficacy drug.
not good test understanding total impact drug. reality
things, drug outperforms placebo, start prescribing it. reality is,
total effect drug, combined product specific chemical attributes
drug whatever's going placebo effect, is, least
perspective, beliefs, social context, body's natural ability respond
something. So, placebo effect example. true everything
consume. comes diet eating, true.
matter matters think diet others around
culture think diet. social contexts inform
mindsets, mindsets interact physiology ways produce outcomes
really important. not get dualistic say, either mind not
mind. also not unnecessarily combative say, oh, plant-
based keto whatever. things combined product
actually doing, thinking about. believe it, don't,
skeptical, cases, think eating certain way
don't live that. might even adverse effect stress

00:25:57 Placebo vs Beliefs vs Nocebo Effects

anxiety associated that. - interesting. Along lines belief effects,
call belief effects mindsets? - Sure, yeah. - difference
calling belief effects placebo effects? mean, placebo
effects distinctly different mindset effects less thing. -
related? think placebo effects, maybe reserved conditions
actually taking placebo, inactive substance. get
sort placebo versus drug realm, start looking placebo effects, use


quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

quotes hands here, behavioral health, term kind becomes confusing
not-- milkshake study, didn't give people placebo milkshake,
right? just changed believed it. So, like think that,
placebo effects, traditionally construed made three things.
social context, mindsets beliefs, natural physiological processes brain
body can produce outcomes. so, just call belief effects
beliefs triggering physiological processes, beliefs
shaped social context. make sense? - makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah,
paper year two ago published science magazine brain regions
involved psychogenic fever. people can actually animal
models think sick, get genuine one three degree increase
body temperature, one three degrees Fahrenheit increase body temperature
pretty impressive. - Yeah. - guess plays symptomology generally. So,
believer belief effects. - Just say that, know, term use field
nocebo effect that, sort placebo's ugly stepsister. negative
beliefs cause negative consequences. So, told will have-- well
demonstrated people told certain side effects, far likely
experience side effects. people think sick going get sick,
sometimes can create physiological symptoms. various debates.
not physiology changes, also attention changes.
experiencing things like fatigue headache upset stomach time.
take drug somebody says, going feel fatigue headache,
start noticing tired, headaches attributed drug.

00:28:57 Mindset (Dramatically) Impacts Effects Exercise

So, mechanisms attention, real changes
physiology. - love tell us hotel workers study. - Yeah, sure. -
know get asked questions time, find just results also
amazing. - Yeah, no, think really good example phenomenon, right?
total effect anything combined product
think doing. study ran Ellen Langer way back
undergrad actually. started study. Ellen Langer professor
psychology Harvard, done lot really fascinating work flavor


mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also

of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly

importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

mindfulness, distinct Eastern mind, Buddhist sort mindfulness-
based work. actually one said originally, know,
athlete time. ice hockey player training constantly. one
day never forget it. said, know benefit exercise just placebo, right?
like, well, outrageous. Ellen's known saying provocative,
also wise things. statement really got thinking that.
designed study together look at, study?
benefits exercise placebo, even test that? Because,
mean give placebo exercise? sort flipped head. found
group people getting lot exercise, weren't aware it,
were, right? this, settled group hotel housekeepers. women
working hotels feet day long, pushing carts, changing linens,
climbing stairs, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming. clear getting
beyond least surgeon General's requirements time,
accumulate 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day.
interesting went surveyed asked them, Hey, much
exercise think getting? third said, zero. don't get exercise.
average response like three, scale zero 10. clear
even though women active, didn't mindset, right?
mindset work just work. Hard, maybe thankless work led
feel tired pain end day. not good them,
good exercise. took women randomized
two groups, told half work good exercise. case,
true factual information. oriented surgeon General's guidelines.
oriented benefits receiving. measured
previously, physiological metrics, like weight body fat blood
pressure. came back four weeks later tested again.
found women, even though hadn't changed anything
behavior, least detectable us. didn't work rooms, didn't
start pull-ups push-ups cleaning hotel rooms, far
concerned. didn't report changes diet, benefits
health. lost weight. decreased systolic blood pressure 10
points average. started feeling better themselves, bodies
work, not surprisingly. - amazing. conceptualize result light


efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

efforts get exercise, right? earlier mentioned
milkshake study perceptions nutrient density, right
message actually little bit counterintuitive. think, oh, low
calorie, nutrient sparse, good context losing weight instance.
turns opposite true, told us, body responds
differently think something nutrient dense can actually suppress hunger
more. So, light result, say, okay, current understanding
literature getting somewhere 150 180 minutes per week
cardiovascular exercise probably good idea people. tell
not just good idea, extremely effective lowering blood pressure
maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera, according results, will
enhanced effect metrics.

00:33:44 Motivational Messaging & Mindset Fitness

right? - Definitely. really important point, reveals
thoughtful go motivating people exercise
teaching people benefits. current approach just basically tell people,
writ large, need get. need get good for. get
enough exercise receive health benefit. problem approach that,
people aren't meeting benefits yet, aren't meeting requirements
yet. risk that, well, intention motivate
public health officials think, well, just tell people need get exercise
good you, it. know now doesn't work,
guidelines not motivational. don't change behavior. work
adds that, not not motivational, also creates potentially mindset
makes people worse off without knowing guidelines.
again, tricky. not saying mindset everything. Certainly exercise good
us helpful us. one things best data on. not
saying, oh, exercises placebo. saying that, need
mindful motivate people exercise, help people
actually reap benefits exercise already doing? Now, Octavia,
grad student lab, ran number interesting studies along lines. One
looked three nationally representative data sets, interesting


question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also

of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

question them, much exercise get relative others?
get same, little more, lot more, get little less lot less, right?
So, audience, listeners, answer this. datasets,
did, pulled data tracked death rates next 21
years. couple interesting things revealed themselves. One that,
correlations perceptions exercise relative others, people's
actual exercise measured accelerometer data, well rigorous sort
today, kind data. don't correlate much all. - People lie. -
Well, people lie, also... - misperceive. - ...They misperceive. say,
misperceiving, everything's relative, right? used triathlons seriously.
ask now, feel like totally inactive, right? not anything
near used to. focus set, right? feel like not exercising much.
think about, know, compared people, given know
national representative statistics, feel like, oh, getting lot, right?
can see perceptions decoupled objective reality. found
studies, that, one question mattered cases, objective
activity, cases controlling objective activity predicting death rates.
one samples, 71% higher risk death rate. know, people rated
feeling like getting less activity others. - Wow. big
deal. - big deal. again, study cross-sectional, longitudinal, not
experimental. combined, really sort coalesced say, Hey, important
too, right? Like, figure ways active get people active, also not
make people feel horrible not getting enough. going
back hotel study again, mentioned time division
one ice hockey player time. training time.
unhealthy mindset that, never felt like getting enough. come off
two hour practice weightlifting session. get elliptical 30
minutes, 'cause thought also. teammates
time attest that. so, study really helpful me, realize
needed pay attention, not just doing, also take care mindset
that. think essence get people feel like getting
enough? sense enoughness really matters. - Yeah, can see dilemma
don't want people thinking exercise positive effects
potent can get away three minute walk day. good


likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic

stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

work. important truly unique. Tell us people can
learn research, can find online. going try

likely not. again, don't want back
heels psychologically don't even never exceed
much. seems like message milkshake study talking
now terms exercise

00:39:30 Power ‘Potency & Indulgence’ Mindset

really communicate general public food potency, even
healthy foods potency give us energy, fuel immune system
endocrine system, et cetera. exercise remarkable potency,
potency can enhanced believing understanding potency. - Exactly. -
accurate way state it? - Totally, exactly right. really
feel like need push. try research, not just show, oh,
mindset matters, isn't interesting? matter, right? exercise
think matter. eat think eat
matter. so, really, individuals society need work on,
right way cultivate behaviors mindsets behaviors serve us?
food context, this-- Again, milkshake study really changed
personal level, somebody constantly trying restrain
eating, right? wanted maintain lose weight, look fit. so, like, well,
diet low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that.
doing, putting constant mindset restraint. study
suggested, mindset potentially counteracting benefit
objective effects restrained diet. brain saying, okay,
restraining. Maybe body responding that. brain also saying, eat
food, stay hungry 'cause need survive. so, answer isn't, oh,
throw everything wind just drink indulgent milkshakes day long.
answer is, eat healthy foods, right? Based latest science know
true nutrients body's response them, try mindset
indulgence, mindset satisfaction, mindset enjoyment, right? really
trick. least try life. - love that, get
involved anti-public facing health communications, comes again,
know, conceptualize behavior? think
options offered us? excited potency mindsets



00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

work. important truly unique. Tell us people can
learn research, can find online. going try

00:42:03 Mindsets Sleep, Tracking Sleep

coming again. So, question this. don't know
study ever done, lot mindset effects something years
ago, felt vis-a-vis sleep. graduate school, postdoc,
even undergraduate, much work decided sleep
"dead". Not good idea know. However, found couple nights
minimal sleep even all-nighter pretty well. Eventually
catch me. ever study exploring whether not effects
sleep deprivation can impacted mindset effects? years,
keep learning much sleep need really emphasized
it, feel much better getting it. new parents know, students
know athletes know anyone lives normal life find sometimes don't
get good night's sleep. believing can tolerate push
function just fine, not going kill us give us Alzheimer's.
help us deal poor night's sleep even two chronic sleep deprivation? -
Certainly guess. one study knowledge tested that.
[indistinct] colleagues, looked at-- people come gave
sort a, think sham sort EEG test figure how-- done
number years ago. Now actually devices test this,
sham test. gave people fake feedback quality sleep
night before. also asked participants felt
sleep. essentially found sham feedback,
told gotten let lower quality sleep led deficits variety
cognitive tasks. sort decoupled actual [laughs] qualities
sleep, least self-reported. one study attest this, think certainly,
bet lot money, haven't run myself, mindsets can push
around cognitive functioning, physiological effects sleep. again, not
nothing, right? real important benefits sleep, far can push
around mindset, open question. - know what? result
mentioned really interesting lot people use sleep trackers now.
using rings wristbands. fact, lab worked pretty closely
company supplied us data well people sleeping, get


score, people get score back. see score, might think based
results,

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

work. important truly unique. Tell us people can
learn research, can find online. going try
persuade take social media presence going forward. whether not
succeed effort not, can people find you, ask questions, find

00:45:00 Making Stress Work (or Against)

oh, recovery score, sleep score poor. shouldn't expect much
today, makes sense memory going. reason,
probably lose friends saying this, hopefully gain well.
like just subjective score myself. wake morning, just decide,
okay, sleep well not? don't like seeing number. don't like getting readout
device. me, know lot people like it, can useful.
gosh, seems belief effects weaving levels. love us talk
stress, lab worked extensively this. would,
tell us point study done informing people
different effects stress. also, opportunity, takeaways
conceptualize stress ways make serve us better
opposed harm us mental physical performance. - Great, yeah,
come off heels research exercise diet finding
provocative also counterintuitive effects respect try
motivate people, right? And, thinking this, grouping going
medicines saving us behaviors saving us, behaviors might
influenced mindsets. obvious next thing think stress, right?
like, okay, well want healthier fix diet, fix exercise
stress less. started digging nature stress
couple things clear. One public health message clear, right?
stress bad, right? Unmitigated harmful health, productivity,
relationships, fertility, cognition, name it, right? messages
there, large over-simplified messages focused damaging
consequences stress. know, actually dive deeper literature
stress origins stress, find that, literature like
literatures not clear cut. fact, large amount evidence support
fact experience stress, meaning encountering adversity challenge
one's goal related efforts, not debilitating. many cases,
body's response designed enhance ability manage moments,


right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

right? research showing stress narrows focus, increases attention,
speeds rate able process information. research
showing phenomenon physiological toughening, process
release catabolic hormones stress response recruit activate anabolic
hormones, help know build muscles, build neurons, help us grow
learn. whole body emerging research post-traumatic growth
phenomenon even experience traumatic stressors,
chronic enduring stressors, lead not destruction, fact,
exact opposite, enhanced sense connection values, connection
others, sense joy passion living. so, found interesting.
work since not try argue stress enhancing not debilitating,
try point true nature stress paradox. true nature stress
manifold complex, lots things can happen. question, role
mindset stress shaping response stress. work already
done looking perception stressor, right? So, view stressor
like challenging exam health diagnosis challenge threat.
shown pretty convincingly view stressors challenge, less
threat, brain body responds adaptively. question was,
take sort psychological construal one step higher abstraction. not just
stressor, nature stress, right? core level, view stress
something bad, going kill us therefore avoided, view
stress natural something going enhance us? so, set
design series studies test extent mindsets stress
mattered. first, Peter Salovey Shawn Achor, originally.
designed measure test people's mindsets stress. Simple questions like,
extent believe agree disagree statements like, stress enhances
performance productivity. Stress heightens vitality growth, things like that.
found number correlational studies enhancing stress mindset
linked better health outcomes, better wellbeing higher performance.
set see change people's mindsets. first test this,
decided creating multimedia films showcased research,
anecdotes, facts stress, true, oriented towards one mindset other,
right? can imagine one set films showed basically messages
public health context. showed, Hey, know, stress


linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

linked things, fact, body's stress response designed this.
know that? empowering images like LeBron James
making free-throw final minute versus missing it, right? things
true possibilities oriented two different mindsets stress. - either
people saw video basically made seem like stress will diminish you, crush you,
reduce you, video similar, stress will grow you, bring best, maybe
even take heightened levels performance never experienced
before. - Exactly, exactly. So, yeah, examples sports, also like true leaders
emerge moments greatest stress, know, Churchill. so,
examples enhancing nature debilitating nature.
question was, orienting people different mindsets change respond
stress? study done wake 2008 financial crisis. worked
UBS, financial service company undergoing pretty massive amounts
layoffs. employees stressed laid off. taking
pressure. just tough time. randomized three conditions.
pre-work getting training stress, three different
conditions, watched no videos, watched stressful crushy videos
watched stress enhance videos. found just--
total nine minutes videos course week, led changes
mindsets stress, led changes physiological symptoms
associated stress. people watched enhancing films fewer
backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, forth. also reported
performing better work compared watched debilitating videos. Now
interestingly, didn't make anyone worse debilitating videos. - Wow,
good. - good. told IRB didn't expect
message already there, already seeing, wasn't new
them. enhancing perspective turned inspiring. - love
study, know friends ties special operations community
just sort happenstance maybe get little later, good
friend community always says, three ways go life
moment, either back heels, flat-footed forward center mass.
said, well, well, key forward center mass? said, "Stress
places "in forward center mass," meaning leaning forward
challenge. know actually looked community really


seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths

attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things

seem like mindset either going cultivate
course training. notion stress puts us forward motion,
true physiologically, right? mean, adrenaline's major role place us moment
of, bias us towards action, tremble. body trying initiate action.
actually probably good opportunity. anything interesting
extract study SEAL teams, it? - Yeah, no, loved working
SEALs. one interesting things found, studied this, measured
mindset several different populations. every single one tested
far, average debilitating side scale. - People just saying
stress bad. - Stress bad, right? Like measures growth fixed mindsets
intelligence, people middle, oftentimes positive
mindsets intelligence. not case stress, [chuckles]. still not
case. trying get message there. Except group Navy SEALs.
actually recruit, people going basic training
order become Navy SEALs. found average stresses
enhancing mindset, perhaps not surprisingly, right? going devote
whole life Navy SEAL, must inclination stress source
strength you. found them, measured beginning
basic training, buds training, looked well succeeded
program. know, extremely rigorous program.
time like 10 20% trainees. - Still is, numbers never shifted
that. No matter hard pressures community change, numbers
still average, 15%. - Yeah, wow. So, found
measure predicted rate. people even within range stresses
enhancing mindset likely complete training, become SEAL. also
faster obstacle course times, rated peers positively. So,
again, break down, right? doesn't mean, people get wrong
sometimes. think saying, stresses enhancing mindset means
stress, right? Well, maybe SEALs do. not saying, right?
stresses enhancing mindset doesn't mean stressor good thing, right?
doesn't mean good thing go combat not pretty, right?
doesn't mean getting cancer diagnosis good thing abject poverty
good thing. not good things. experience stress associated
that, challenge, adversity, experience can lead enhancing


outcomes respect not just cognition, health, performance
wellbeing. mindset, right? work, right? Well, works
number different pathways. One changes fundamentally motivated
do. just imagine stressed something, maybe global pandemic,
example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat

example. - instance. - instance. think stress bad,
motivation, right? motivation to, well, first get worried stress,
right? Now not pandemic, stressed stress
pandemic. second is, reaction typically one two things. either
freak everything can make sure doesn't affect negatively,
check say, oh, not big deal. not going deal that.
basically denial. So, people stresses debilitating mindset
shown research, tend go one extremes. freak
out, check out, why? stress bad need either get rid
deal needs not exist, right? stressors enhancing mindset,
motivation changes, right? motivation is, utilize stress realize
enhancing outcomes? can here, right? learn experience,
make us stronger, fitter, better science treatments future, deepen
relationships others, improve priorities forth, right? motivation
changes, affect around changes, doesn't make easy deal with.
shown research that, people stresses enhancing mindset
positive effect, not necessarily less negative effect, potentially changes
physiology. studies show people inspired adopt
enhancing mindsets, moderate cortisol response, higher levels
DHA levels response stress. So, work needs done physiology,
love take mechanisms possible. - Yes, DHA
course anabolic hormone men women. interesting,
guest podcast. actually PhD scientist runs UFC
Performance Training Institute, name Duncan French. graduate work
Yukon stores interesting. exercise science physiology.
showed that, spike adrenaline response... think
first time skydive something like that. ...That testosterone went up. Now,
spits face everything told stress testosterone levels, right?
also looked females estrogen. Although course,
estrogen testosterone, males females, designed


study. turns least short term, stressful event can
raise anabolic hormones. think people forget mechanistic level
adrenaline epinephrin, epinephrin biochemically derived molecule
dopamine. look pathway, even just Google go images, see
adrenaline made dopamine. dopamine anabolic hormones
sort close cousins. work together pituitary hypothalamus.
makes sense one leverage stress toward growth, towards anibalism
opposed cannibalism, not saying cannibalism eating people,
catabolic processes, guess, right way refer it. remarkable
me, brain structures control dopamine, epinephrin, testosterone
estrogen, thought subconscious, meaning ability
flip switch turn off. - [Alia] Right. - yet mindset seemed impact
them. say, clear mechanistic basis
work. one hand surprised, incredible results.
hand, not surprised physiological substrate

01:01:50 Mindsets Link Conscious & Subconscious

readily explain them. - Yeah, think figuring exactly works
really, [chuckles]. - that. - that. - collaborate. -
it. - got common friends departments, it. -
want mention, way think mindset, again, think need study
this. not neuroscientist, haven't looked this, something
do. way think mindset, mindsets kind portal
conscious subconscious processes. operate default setting mind,
right? So, sort programmed there, stress equals bad, right?
going something maybe conscious, right? doesn't conscious,
right? People don't know mindsets stress asked really.
programmed upbringing, public health messages
media things. kind sits assumption brain,
brain figuring respond situation?
assumption, default, programming is, stress bad, going to,
subconscious trigger, things like, okay, well, need rev things
protect versus rev things help grow. so, least think


it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.

of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

learn research, can find online. going try
persuade take social media presence going forward. whether not
succeed effort not, can people find you, ask questions, find

it. cool that, operates sort portal,
communicates subconscious physiological processes, can also
accessed consciousness, right? just talking this, right?
listeners, now invited bring stress mindsets consciousness
say, stress mindset? thinking stress? Can reprogram that?
Can start think enhancing? takes little bit conscious work
potentially, that, can kind operate background,
influencing body responds don't say, okay, stressed,
better tell anabolic hormones. - Right, right. - doesn't work way. - No. -
mindsets can help translational process. - love idea mindsets
interface conscious subconscious. think lot
unpack there. clearly case, mindset, sort act heuristics,
right? talked earlier, can limit number things focus
on. one thing really stressful trying focus everything time.
trying navigate public health around anything. public health
information around anything kind overwhelming. mentioned stress,
see lot stresses will crush you,

01:04:50 3 Best Ways Leverage Stress

can also find evidence stress will grow you. we,
listeners, think stress adaptive way think stress?
talk stress? not talk stress? short list
ways can cope stress better? - Yeah. - careful word
cope. way can leverage stress advantage? - Great, yeah,
important nuance language, people large come
place manage stress? cope it? implies,
fight it, right? - Vacation, massages, yoga classes. - Fight check
it, right? - Exactly, exactly. - yeah, real challenge is,
leverage it? utilize it? work it? yeah, lot
thoughts this. first important thing clarify definition stress.
think people often associate-- negative stress mindset insidious, now
people define stress negative consequences. first step decouple that,
realize stress neutral, right? Yet determined effect experiencing


anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question

anticipating adversity goal related efforts. let unpack little more,
can midst it, just worried something happening.
one aspect. Second is, adversity challenge, something working
you. third piece critical, goal related efforts.
means that, stress things care about, things matter us.
really important, right? stress linked with, side
coin things care about, right? so, think first thing realize, right?
humans, stress care, don't stress things don't
care about. simplified example like use is, know, Johnny failing
school, wouldn't stress out, unless Johnny son Johnny,
really cared educating Johnny's world, right? becomes
stressful extent care it. So, trying fight run away
hide merely cope stress overcome massages,
stress connected things care about. question becomes, okay,
true, can better utilize leverage respond inevitable stresses
going experience? not saying go seek stress.
saying that, going experience stress cares values
passions us do. so, do? developed
three-step approach adopting stresses enhancing mindset, briefly, first step
just acknowledge stressed, it, see it, mindful it. second
step welcome it. welcome it? welcome inherently
stress something care about. using opportunity
reconnect care here? third step utilize
stress response, achieve thing care about, not spend time, money,
effort, energy, trying get rid stress. make sense? - Makes sense
love it. somebody laboratory studies, physiological effects stress,
effects impressed instance, narrowing visual attention,
drives capacity pass time finely, drives capacity
process information faster. almost like superpower. - Right. - yes, can feel
uncomfortable often, love idea that, acknowledging it, embracing
understanding power leveraging power. think like much
framework stress response generic. Unlike relaxation response,
don't actually train stress response. kind get freebie.
sounds like question end that. - Right,


Hans Selye, father stress said himself, nonspecific response, right? occurs,
it. channeling it. yeah, like talked
before, people stress stress,
exacerbates it, check stress, leads depression
anhedonia. checking stress, also checking
things care about. - substance abuse. - Exactly. - colleague Anna Lembke,
also good fortune guest podcast, talked lot
this. mean, much substance abuse, runs addiction clinic
med side campus. takes people's lives increased
stability find solution stress, eventually becomes stressor

01:10:40 4 Things Shape Mindsets, Influencers & Mindsets

problem. Well, love mindset framework. love tell us
just bit right now, exciting now.
able willing talk work way. saw brief mention
something publications website paper influencers, online
influencers nutrition. Now, might not main thrust to,
able tell us it, sort interesting given lot communication
around podcast takes place social media. kind launched
landscape now constantly bombarded health information influencers,
right? time didn't even know couple [mumbles]. - one. - One
argue one way other, deal influencers?
something good health information ruining landscape? don't try
protect feelings. 'Cause now know stress actually asset. - Yeah, well,
work part body work sort venturing into,
understand mindsets come from, right? mentioned sort public
health entities one source of, say mindsets stress. think
mindsets influenced four different sources. First upbringing,
parents talked about, things like stressed food things. Second
culture media. movies, podcasts, now social media. Third influential
others. doctors say us close friends peers. fourth conscious
choice. So, talked little. humans ability
mindful of, change mindsets. social media influencer stuff


part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful

01:36:20 Stanford Mind & Body Lab, Resources Stress

work. important truly unique. Tell us people can
learn research, can find online. going try
persuade take social media presence going forward. whether not
succeed effort not, can people find you, ask questions, find
papers, learn more. love back conversation future,
meantime. - Yeah, honor getting chat just
impact world. look forward. hope can science
together also. - Absolutely, absolutely. - Yeah, papers materials
interventions housed website, mbl.stanford.edu. also link
too, takes Stanford SPARK, stands social psychological answers
real world questions. lot toolkits website, including toolkit

guess Twitter, Alia Crum, [chuckles], don't much there, maybe will start
to. - Well, great resources. will provide links
listeners viewers. also hope convince write book many books
future. world needs know this, thank much taking time
exceedingly busy schedule talk us ideas. learned
much. going definitely think effect mindset blank
every category life really, behalf everybody myself. Thank much.

part attempt understand mindsets things like healthy
foods come from. Brad Turnwald, former grad student lab
done series really interesting studies this, showing that, rate nutritional
quality top grossing movies last 20 years, look Instagram
accounts influential people Instagram, analyze nutrition
content eating, shown that, depending study, 70
90% movies influencers fail legal standards advertising
UK. putting nutrition contents are, maybe not surprisingly,
undeniably unhealthy. me, interesting important. shows
getting mindset unhealthy foods pleasurable, desirable.
maybe even interesting work others lab
done show ways people talking foods eating really
matter too. generally found people talk unhealthy
foods, use language connotes sense excitement, fun, sexiness, danger,
indulgence, basically anything good desirable, right? - cookies,
cakes, high sugar. - Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods. actually-- objective,
what? Helped challenging, yeah, high fat, high sugar. - Yeah, think
pretty good agreement now excessive sugar isn't good. - Yeah, highly
processed. - Yeah, highly processed, et cetera, et cetera. think general
consensus. sure someone will-- going come anyone come me,
stand behind [mumbles]. - hand, people talking about,
do, which, know, healthy foods aren't portrayed media, aren't portrayed
influencers rarely ever. are, often talked language
conveys sense deprivation. nutritious, sort boring, bland.
not tasty. - Recovering holidays. Sort post-holiday reset, right? - Exactly,
really important work trying, others
work, trying inform people actually good them.
meanwhile, hurricane force telling people, seeping
minds, sure, might good you, foods not fun sexy
indulgent desirable way, shape form, right? also paid advertising
fast foods sugary beverages things. not surprising
mindset, healthy foods less desirable thing eat cultural
social forces. work just tried reveal that, quantify it,
way say, right, maybe little bit mindful talk


healthy foods. movie producer, can little bit mindful
showcase healthy delicious foods characters talk ways
appealing? lot room people produce content
impact, not just people do, think foods
eating. - really interesting. hadn't thought now, makes sense
food packaging can sold as, can woven film promoted
celebrity influencer, not health influencer per se, celebrity influencer
get paid, right? part ecosystem allows income feeds
back sales company. Whereas things can't commoditized,
difficult, right? hard whoever makes oranges sells oranges unlikely
promote oranges celebrity post movie oranges can purchased
many, many sources. no identifiable source oranges
packaged food, instance. - Yeah, interesting thing found studies
wasn't driven promoted content branded content.
certainly, yeah, promoted branded content usually processed
high sugar foods. 90% foods showing not
promoted branded. so, lot flexibility producers
influencers show media. Although goes ways, right? not just
producers influencers responsibility, public reacting this.
showed people respond positively, likes posts
unhealthy foods. sort distasteful neck it, know, distasteful
culture around healthy eating really lot change it. - Yeah,
dopamine circuits through, just site calorie dense,
extremely tasty food drives dopamine circuits. realized people
derive sort of, similar levels pleasure healthy foods.
wonderful thing one can accomplish that. just need that,
sounds like. - Yeah, exactly. really inspiring. least,
that, possible, right? mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables just inherently
less tasty ice cream. like, well, not necessarily true. Also doesn't
competition, right? don't get three-year-old hate ice cream
order like broccoli. lot can help shape
positive approach oriented, indulgent mindset around healthy, nutritious vegetables
fruits foods, right? addition like ice cream, right?
totally fine. - So, really interesting study. published, let know all. -


Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

Yeah, think actually released week, yeah. JAMA Internal Medicine.

01:19:40 Mindsets Medicines & Side Effects

- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal. will definitely talk social media
elsewhere, sounds interesting. else lately? favorite question
ask scientist colleague way, excited lately?
late thinking getting early thinking about? - Yeah,
hands down, thing [mumbles], well, guess many things.
thing right now, work is, know, started
getting inspired placebo effects medicine. long stint placebo belief like
effects behavioral health. now moving back medicine. really
interested looking can work active drugs treatments, make
better make experience better instilling different mindsets. So, one
study along lines, worked kids undergoing treatment food
allergies. allergies peanuts, example, Kari Nadeau,
head Stanford Allergy Center here. great treatment food allergies.
Basically kids take gradually increasing doses thing allergic to, like
peanuts. course six seven months, kids become less reactive
peanuts. problem treatment really difficult
sorts negative symptoms side effects. kids getting itchy mouths
upset stomach, puking scary, literally eating thing
told might kill them, right? study,
attempted improve experience outcomes that, reframing mindsets
symptoms side effects. conducted before, kids
told, look, side effects just unfortunate by-product treatment,
sort endure get it. found conversation
Kari, reality side effects not negative. fact,
mechanistically linked body learning tolerate peanuts allergen.
worked within trial. getting treatment, half
helped see positive mindsets. symptoms side effects
treatment, positive signal treatment working
bodies getting stronger. found mindset led reductions
anxiety, fewer symptoms, highest doses interestingly all,


better outcomes. based immune markers, assign allergic
tolerance, mindset throughout better outcomes treatment.
just one example. think, goal really move us beyond placebo
versus drug, mindset versus behavior, get place can blend
together maximize benefit treatments. lot studies
like that, know, can improve treatment cancer different mindsets?
done work recently COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms side
effects. really passionate right now. - incredible. can't wait
read study. one way? - Yes. - Okay, well will also read
communicate that. knows, maybe come
Instagram little Instagram live make sure don't screw delivery
can hear direct person ran study. find issue side
effects really interesting. don't take lot prescription drugs, recently
prescribed few, list side effects is, incredible just goes
on. realize legal protections. hard believe
actually expecting anyone read need high powered microscope
read this, print truly fine print. realize reading side effects
one prime themselves, experience side effects. now just rip
side effects thing sheet, just throw away. just take recommended.
think works direction effective medication
supposed result A, B C, told again, effective
treatment, amplify effect. words, strictly placebo.
not nocebo, described before. perhaps lower dose, given
medication amplified effect appropriate dose, will,
super physiological effect. ever demonstrated? - degree.
think gets tricky is, long time, people thought effects placebos
expectancy based. expect get benefit benefit occurs.
certainly some, truth that, think mindset approach powerful
helps us understand mechanisms, right? just expect
blood pressure will go down, mechanisms expectation
lead blood pressure going way? hard even understand that,
right? mindset that, good hands, taken
care of, illness not going kill you, right? treated well.
can start unpack mechanisms blood pressure


relieved. Maybe anxiety reduction, maybe changing sort anticipation
prioritization body needs focus on. so, really think that,
work future needs getting sophisticated
mindset instilling say something will work won't work.
understand mechanisms changes physiology?
answer question, think true, depends actually
mindset

01:26:25 Teach Mindsets

evoking. - know parent, parents there, also
kids people don't kids, best way learn teach mindsets?
mean, clearly conversation like informs many people
mindsets can adopt them. also seems
opportunity teach mindsets really cultivate certain mindsets, world will
much better place. - Yes. - one go that? Given kids
bombarded conflicting information time,
anchor mindset? - Yeah, getting major passion right now,
calling lab, meta mindset. working Chris Evans
others. is, consciously deliberately change mindsets?
first step really simple, just aware them.
world, beliefs, aren't sort unmitigated reflection reality objectively
is. filtered interpretations, expectations, frameworks,
simplifications reality. know, work know,
well goes brain interpretation reality. Mindsets
just simplified core assumptions things. first step realize
them. second step start think about, effects mindsets
life sort play story, right? Okay, mindset stress
debilitating. making feel? leading do? mindset
helpful harmful? question isn't mindset right wrong? can
find evidence it. can fight exhausted. question
is, helpful harmful? then, can go seeking ways adopt
useful mindsets. So, lot work actually that.
consciously change it? Sometimes really simple. think cases don't


lot prior experience, like kids allergies getting treatment,
didn't mindsets symptoms. just luxury setting it,
right? comes healthy food, think harder change people's mindsets
lot baggage weighing us down. parent, me, guess
number one piece advice lighten up, trying get kids certain things
focus helping adopt adaptive mindsets. So, no means
expert this, testing child. - child real, real child. real
kind experiment. - resist urge force child eat dinner
can dessert, right? real urge. like, no, need
- negotiating. - that. start thinking terms
mindset, realize, oh, just reinforcing her, dessert exciting, fun
thing have. thing must horrible. horrible
parent forcing it, right? letting go little bit behavior,
objective reality, really thinking subjective reality focusing adaptive
mindsets. goal parent try help instill healthy mindset
eating, healthy foods indulgent delicious. experience
stress inevitable, natural. going stressful experience can help
learn, grow, become connected happier individual.
exercise physical activity, haven't really gotten yet, [laughs] will
time. - Yeah, great. wrote going keep front
mind, going forward, continually ask effect mindset X?
just evaluate that. exercise, food, school, stress,
relationships, relationship self, et cetera. really think
series layers think useful exercise? - Definitely,
know, work speaks this. mean, mindful, not-- really urge
people getting dogmatic mindset also, right? Like, oh, need
right mindset. Or, don't right mind-- like, okay, mindset piece
puzzle. piece puzzle really empowering
access can change it. just one piece puzzle. treat
like scientist, look life, look mindsets, see serving you, see
isn't. Find useful, adaptive, empowering mindsets

01:31:47 Dr. Crum’s Research, Clinical & Athletic Backgrounds



live those. - love it. Now, one version kind discussion,
asked question going ask next beginning, going ask now
close end, is, unique constellation accomplishments attributes,
know subset them, course, today's first time
met person, even though known work long time colleagues
across campus. run laboratory, research. also
athlete university, serious athlete, also clinical psychologist,
right? - trained clinical psychologist. PhD clinical psychology.
pre post internships dealt stress trauma. - see
patients see patients time? - did. Yes, don't anymore. - Okay,
unique constellation practitioner researcher. mindsets
try adopt regular basis consequence relation things,
sort athlete, researcher, clinician? move life,
overarching mindset challenge's good, kind central
mindsets help navigate through, know, passed pretty complex
set daily routines given everything juggle. think people like
unique, inside knowledge stuff works, also
existed different domains. know lot listeners athletic
slant life cognitive raising kids, people
number things. So, think useful people hear kind
of, do? asking. - Yeah, well, certainly true case,
research search. Everything study intellectual come
experience failings, right? really intensely exercising
training, questions asked dealing eating
concerns weight, questions asked. stressed
dissertation. decided dissertation stress, right? Now think
midst global pandemic. can mindsets useful here? don't think
obvious answer question guiding light
undercurrent understanding mindsets matter. think got clearly
deeply child, experiences athlete. know many
listeners athletes. athlete knows can physical
one day next one moment next, perform completely differently, just
depending thinking. gymnast growing up. can't
visualize, can't see something mind no chance


get balance beam, right? also, father martial artist,
teacher meditation. kind mind body work baked early
age. think done recently, try understand scientifically,
importantly, figure can better this, right? talking AI
taking world, technology personalized medicine that,
like, done little, relatively, little human resource, human
brains, potential great. done almost nothing. Take
placebo effect, know lot is. done almost nothing leverage
medicine consciously deliberately. So, keeps going, gets
hard times just burning question of, going
can power mind? - Well, millions people
grateful
