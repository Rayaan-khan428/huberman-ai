now discussion Dr. David Berson, welcome. - Thank you. - Yeah. - nice
here. - Great you. 20 years go-to source
things, nervous system works, structured. today want ask
questions that. think people gain lot insight machine
makes think feel see, et cetera. would, tell us
see? photon light enters eye, happens? - Right. - look
outside, see truck drive by, look wall see photo dog,
work? - Right, old question obviously. clearly end, reason
visual experience brain got pattern activity
associates input periphery. can visual experience
no input periphery well. dreaming, seeing things


aren't coming eyes. - memories? - say sense
may reflect visual experience not necessarily specific visual memories,
course can be. point is, experience seeing actually brain
phenomenon. course, normal circumstances, see world
looking using eyes look it. fundamentally,
looking exterior world, retina telling brain matters.
cells called ganglion cells, neurons key cells
communicating eye brain, eye like camera, detecting
initial image, initial processing, signal gets sent back
brain proper course, level cortex
conscious visual experience. many places brain

00:10:02 Color Vision

get visual input well things kind information. - get
lot questions color vision. would, explain can
perceive reds greens blues things sort. - Right, first thing
understand light, just form electromagnetic radiation, vibrating,
oscillating, but. - say vibrating, oscillating, mean photons
actually moving? - Well sense, photons certainly moving space,
think photons particles one way thinking light,
can also think wave like radio wave, either way acceptable. radio
waves frequencies like frequencies radio dial, certain
frequencies electromagnetic spectrum can detected neurons retina,
things see, still different wavelengths within light
can seen eye. different wavelengths unpacked sense
decoded nervous system lead experience color. Essentially, different
wavelengths give us sensation different colors auspices different
neurons tuned different wavelengths light. - photon,
little bit light hits eye goes in, photoreceptors convert electrical signal?
- Right. - given photon light gives perception eventually, leads
perception red versus green versus blue? - Right, imagine first
layer retina transformation occurs electromagnetic radiation
neural signals different kinds sensitive cells expressing,


making different molecules within express purpose absorbing
photons first step process seeing, now turns altogether,
five proteins like need think typical retina,
seeing color really three them. three different proteins, absorbs
light different preferred frequency, nervous system keeps track
signals compares contrasts extract understanding
wavelength composition light. can see just looking landscape,
must late day things looking golden function
absorbing light coming world interpreting brain
different composition light reaching eyes. - fair
assume perception red perception red? - Well,
great question. - mine better? just kidding, just kidding. [laughs] -
great question, deep philosophical question. question really probably
can't even ultimately answered usual empirical scientific processes, 'cause
really individual's experience. can say biological
mechanisms think important seeing color example, seem
highly similar one individual next whether human beings,
animals. think physiological process looks similar front
end, level perception understanding experience,
something little bit tougher

00:13:47 “Strange” Vision

nail sorts scientific approaches approach biological vision
say. - mentioned five different cone types essentially, cones
cells absorb light different wavelengths. often wondered
dog, saw vision differs vision. certainly,
animals can see things can't see. - Right? -
outrageous examples that? - seen things. - things extreme. -
Right. - Dogs guessing see reds oranges, right? 'Cause don't
array neurons seeing color. - Right, first
thing is, not really five types colons, really three types colons.
look way color vision thought work, can sort see
three different signals. couple types pigments. One really


mostly dim light vision. walking around moonless night
seeing things low light rod cell uses pigment.
another class pigments probably talk little bit later,
melanopsin pigment. - thought referring like ultraviolet infrared
things like that. - Right, case typical, well, put way. human
beings, us three cone types can see colors stem that.
mammals including dog cat, really two cone types
limits kind vision can domain wavelength color
say. really, dog sees world kind like particular kind color blind
human might see world, instead three channels compare
contrast two channels makes much difficult figure
exactly wavelength looking at. - colorblind people suffer much
consequence colorblind? - Well, like many disabilities. world
built people common type. cases, expectation can
somebody can see something won't able missing one
cone types say. moments, can real problem.
lack contrast visual system, will blind that. general, fairly
modest visual limitation things go. example, not able see acutely can
much damaging, not able read fine print example. - Yeah,
suppose give ability see certain colors give ability see
clearly, certainly trade color clarity. - Right, course, color
meaningful us human beings, hate give up. obviously, dogs
cats kinds mammals perfectly well world. - Yeah,
take care them.

00:16:56 Orient Time

spent time taking care dog. - took care too. talk
odd photopigment. Photopigment course thing absorbs light
particular wavelength, talk specialized ganglion cells
communicate certain types information eye brain important
many things. referring course is, co-discovery so-
called intrinsically photosensitive cells, neurons eye many
things don't actually perception, important


biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -

now discussion Dr. David Berson, welcome. - Thank you. - Yeah. - nice
here. - Great you. 20 years go-to source
things, nervous system works, structured. today want ask
questions that. think people gain lot insight machine
makes think feel see, et cetera. would, tell us
see? photon light enters eye, happens? - Right. - look
outside, see truck drive by, look wall see photo dog,
work? - Right, old question obviously. clearly end, reason
visual experience brain got pattern activity
associates input periphery. can visual experience
no input periphery well. dreaming, seeing things


aren't coming eyes. - memories? - say sense
may reflect visual experience not necessarily specific visual memories,
course can be. point is, experience seeing actually brain
phenomenon. course, normal circumstances, see world
looking using eyes look it. fundamentally,
looking exterior world, retina telling brain matters.
cells called ganglion cells, neurons key cells
communicating eye brain, eye like camera, detecting
initial image, initial processing, signal gets sent back
brain proper course, level cortex
conscious visual experience. many places brain

00:10:02 Color Vision

get visual input well things kind information. - get
lot questions color vision. would, explain can
perceive reds greens blues things sort. - Right, first thing
understand light, just form electromagnetic radiation, vibrating,
oscillating, but. - say vibrating, oscillating, mean photons
actually moving? - Well sense, photons certainly moving space,
think photons particles one way thinking light,
can also think wave like radio wave, either way acceptable. radio
waves frequencies like frequencies radio dial, certain
frequencies electromagnetic spectrum can detected neurons retina,
things see, still different wavelengths within light
can seen eye. different wavelengths unpacked sense
decoded nervous system lead experience color. Essentially, different
wavelengths give us sensation different colors auspices different
neurons tuned different wavelengths light. - photon,
little bit light hits eye goes in, photoreceptors convert electrical signal?
- Right. - given photon light gives perception eventually, leads
perception red versus green versus blue? - Right, imagine first
layer retina transformation occurs electromagnetic radiation
neural signals different kinds sensitive cells expressing,


making different molecules within express purpose absorbing
photons first step process seeing, now turns altogether,
five proteins like need think typical retina,
seeing color really three them. three different proteins, absorbs
light different preferred frequency, nervous system keeps track
signals compares contrasts extract understanding
wavelength composition light. can see just looking landscape,
must late day things looking golden function
absorbing light coming world interpreting brain
different composition light reaching eyes. - fair
assume perception red perception red? - Well,
great question. - mine better? just kidding, just kidding. [laughs] -
great question, deep philosophical question. question really probably
can't even ultimately answered usual empirical scientific processes, 'cause
really individual's experience. can say biological
mechanisms think important seeing color example, seem
highly similar one individual next whether human beings,
animals. think physiological process looks similar front
end, level perception understanding experience,
something little bit tougher

00:13:47 “Strange” Vision

nail sorts scientific approaches approach biological vision
say. - mentioned five different cone types essentially, cones
cells absorb light different wavelengths. often wondered
dog, saw vision differs vision. certainly,
animals can see things can't see. - Right? -
outrageous examples that? - seen things. - things extreme. -
Right. - Dogs guessing see reds oranges, right? 'Cause don't
array neurons seeing color. - Right, first
thing is, not really five types colons, really three types colons.
look way color vision thought work, can sort see
three different signals. couple types pigments. One really


mostly dim light vision. walking around moonless night
seeing things low light rod cell uses pigment.
another class pigments probably talk little bit later,
melanopsin pigment. - thought referring like ultraviolet infrared
things like that. - Right, case typical, well, put way. human
beings, us three cone types can see colors stem that.
mammals including dog cat, really two cone types
limits kind vision can domain wavelength color
say. really, dog sees world kind like particular kind color blind
human might see world, instead three channels compare
contrast two channels makes much difficult figure
exactly wavelength looking at. - colorblind people suffer much
consequence colorblind? - Well, like many disabilities. world
built people common type. cases, expectation can
somebody can see something won't able missing one
cone types say. moments, can real problem.
lack contrast visual system, will blind that. general, fairly
modest visual limitation things go. example, not able see acutely can
much damaging, not able read fine print example. - Yeah,
suppose give ability see certain colors give ability see
clearly, certainly trade color clarity. - Right, course, color
meaningful us human beings, hate give up. obviously, dogs
cats kinds mammals perfectly well world. - Yeah,
take care them.

00:16:56 Orient Time

spent time taking care dog. - took care too. talk
odd photopigment. Photopigment course thing absorbs light
particular wavelength, talk specialized ganglion cells
communicate certain types information eye brain important
many things. referring course is, co-discovery so-
called intrinsically photosensitive cells, neurons eye many
things don't actually perception, important


biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal

deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

aren't coming eyes. - memories? - say sense
may reflect visual experience not necessarily specific visual memories,
course can be. point is, experience seeing actually brain
phenomenon. course, normal circumstances, see world
looking using eyes look it. fundamentally,
looking exterior world, retina telling brain matters.
cells called ganglion cells, neurons key cells
communicating eye brain, eye like camera, detecting
initial image, initial processing, signal gets sent back
brain proper course, level cortex
conscious visual experience. many places brain

00:10:02 Color Vision

get visual input well things kind information. - get
lot questions color vision. would, explain can
perceive reds greens blues things sort. - Right, first thing
understand light, just form electromagnetic radiation, vibrating,
oscillating, but. - say vibrating, oscillating, mean photons
actually moving? - Well sense, photons certainly moving space,
think photons particles one way thinking light,
can also think wave like radio wave, either way acceptable. radio
waves frequencies like frequencies radio dial, certain
frequencies electromagnetic spectrum can detected neurons retina,
things see, still different wavelengths within light
can seen eye. different wavelengths unpacked sense
decoded nervous system lead experience color. Essentially, different
wavelengths give us sensation different colors auspices different
neurons tuned different wavelengths light. - photon,
little bit light hits eye goes in, photoreceptors convert electrical signal?
- Right. - given photon light gives perception eventually, leads
perception red versus green versus blue? - Right, imagine first
layer retina transformation occurs electromagnetic radiation
neural signals different kinds sensitive cells expressing,


making different molecules within express purpose absorbing
photons first step process seeing, now turns altogether,
five proteins like need think typical retina,
seeing color really three them. three different proteins, absorbs
light different preferred frequency, nervous system keeps track
signals compares contrasts extract understanding
wavelength composition light. can see just looking landscape,
must late day things looking golden function
absorbing light coming world interpreting brain
different composition light reaching eyes. - fair
assume perception red perception red? - Well,
great question. - mine better? just kidding, just kidding. [laughs] -
great question, deep philosophical question. question really probably
can't even ultimately answered usual empirical scientific processes, 'cause
really individual's experience. can say biological
mechanisms think important seeing color example, seem
highly similar one individual next whether human beings,
animals. think physiological process looks similar front
end, level perception understanding experience,
something little bit tougher

00:13:47 “Strange” Vision

nail sorts scientific approaches approach biological vision
say. - mentioned five different cone types essentially, cones
cells absorb light different wavelengths. often wondered
dog, saw vision differs vision. certainly,
animals can see things can't see. - Right? -
outrageous examples that? - seen things. - things extreme. -
Right. - Dogs guessing see reds oranges, right? 'Cause don't
array neurons seeing color. - Right, first
thing is, not really five types colons, really three types colons.
look way color vision thought work, can sort see
three different signals. couple types pigments. One really


mostly dim light vision. walking around moonless night
seeing things low light rod cell uses pigment.
another class pigments probably talk little bit later,
melanopsin pigment. - thought referring like ultraviolet infrared
things like that. - Right, case typical, well, put way. human
beings, us three cone types can see colors stem that.
mammals including dog cat, really two cone types
limits kind vision can domain wavelength color
say. really, dog sees world kind like particular kind color blind
human might see world, instead three channels compare
contrast two channels makes much difficult figure
exactly wavelength looking at. - colorblind people suffer much
consequence colorblind? - Well, like many disabilities. world
built people common type. cases, expectation can
somebody can see something won't able missing one
cone types say. moments, can real problem.
lack contrast visual system, will blind that. general, fairly
modest visual limitation things go. example, not able see acutely can
much damaging, not able read fine print example. - Yeah,
suppose give ability see certain colors give ability see
clearly, certainly trade color clarity. - Right, course, color
meaningful us human beings, hate give up. obviously, dogs
cats kinds mammals perfectly well world. - Yeah,
take care them.

00:16:56 Orient Time

spent time taking care dog. - took care too. talk
odd photopigment. Photopigment course thing absorbs light
particular wavelength, talk specialized ganglion cells
communicate certain types information eye brain important
many things. referring course is, co-discovery so-
called intrinsically photosensitive cells, neurons eye many
things don't actually perception, important


biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help

don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific

point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact

secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center

shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section

now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice

something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals

share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch

making different molecules within express purpose absorbing
photons first step process seeing, now turns altogether,
five proteins like need think typical retina,
seeing color really three them. three different proteins, absorbs
light different preferred frequency, nervous system keeps track
signals compares contrasts extract understanding
wavelength composition light. can see just looking landscape,
must late day things looking golden function
absorbing light coming world interpreting brain
different composition light reaching eyes. - fair
assume perception red perception red? - Well,
great question. - mine better? just kidding, just kidding. [laughs] -
great question, deep philosophical question. question really probably
can't even ultimately answered usual empirical scientific processes, 'cause
really individual's experience. can say biological
mechanisms think important seeing color example, seem
highly similar one individual next whether human beings,
animals. think physiological process looks similar front
end, level perception understanding experience,
something little bit tougher

00:13:47 “Strange” Vision

nail sorts scientific approaches approach biological vision
say. - mentioned five different cone types essentially, cones
cells absorb light different wavelengths. often wondered
dog, saw vision differs vision. certainly,
animals can see things can't see. - Right? -
outrageous examples that? - seen things. - things extreme. -
Right. - Dogs guessing see reds oranges, right? 'Cause don't
array neurons seeing color. - Right, first
thing is, not really five types colons, really three types colons.
look way color vision thought work, can sort see
three different signals. couple types pigments. One really


mostly dim light vision. walking around moonless night
seeing things low light rod cell uses pigment.
another class pigments probably talk little bit later,
melanopsin pigment. - thought referring like ultraviolet infrared
things like that. - Right, case typical, well, put way. human
beings, us three cone types can see colors stem that.
mammals including dog cat, really two cone types
limits kind vision can domain wavelength color
say. really, dog sees world kind like particular kind color blind
human might see world, instead three channels compare
contrast two channels makes much difficult figure
exactly wavelength looking at. - colorblind people suffer much
consequence colorblind? - Well, like many disabilities. world
built people common type. cases, expectation can
somebody can see something won't able missing one
cone types say. moments, can real problem.
lack contrast visual system, will blind that. general, fairly
modest visual limitation things go. example, not able see acutely can
much damaging, not able read fine print example. - Yeah,
suppose give ability see certain colors give ability see
clearly, certainly trade color clarity. - Right, course, color
meaningful us human beings, hate give up. obviously, dogs
cats kinds mammals perfectly well world. - Yeah,
take care them.

00:16:56 Orient Time

spent time taking care dog. - took care too. talk
odd photopigment. Photopigment course thing absorbs light
particular wavelength, talk specialized ganglion cells
communicate certain types information eye brain important
many things. referring course is, co-discovery so-
called intrinsically photosensitive cells, neurons eye many
things don't actually perception, important


biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins

somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single

grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see

looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific

Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion

electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately

mostly dim light vision. walking around moonless night
seeing things low light rod cell uses pigment.
another class pigments probably talk little bit later,
melanopsin pigment. - thought referring like ultraviolet infrared
things like that. - Right, case typical, well, put way. human
beings, us three cone types can see colors stem that.
mammals including dog cat, really two cone types
limits kind vision can domain wavelength color
say. really, dog sees world kind like particular kind color blind
human might see world, instead three channels compare
contrast two channels makes much difficult figure
exactly wavelength looking at. - colorblind people suffer much
consequence colorblind? - Well, like many disabilities. world
built people common type. cases, expectation can
somebody can see something won't able missing one
cone types say. moments, can real problem.
lack contrast visual system, will blind that. general, fairly
modest visual limitation things go. example, not able see acutely can
much damaging, not able read fine print example. - Yeah,
suppose give ability see certain colors give ability see
clearly, certainly trade color clarity. - Right, course, color
meaningful us human beings, hate give up. obviously, dogs
cats kinds mammals perfectly well world. - Yeah,
take care them.

00:16:56 Orient Time

spent time taking care dog. - took care too. talk
odd photopigment. Photopigment course thing absorbs light
particular wavelength, talk specialized ganglion cells
communicate certain types information eye brain important
many things. referring course is, co-discovery so-
called intrinsically photosensitive cells, neurons eye many
things don't actually perception, important


biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit

biological functions. love explain heard
say bit fly eye eye. - Yeah. - showed slide giant
fly horror movie. - Yeah. - Trying attack woman. - Yeah. - maybe
eye also. mean bit fly eye eye? -
Yeah, last pigment really peculiar one. One can think really
initial sensitive element system designed tell brain bright
things world. thing really peculiar pigment,
wrong place sense. think structure retina, think
layer cake essentially. got thin membrane back eye,
actually stack thin layers outermost layers
photoreceptors talking earlier sitting. film
camera essentially, photons magic photo pigments
turn neural signal. - like never really thought photoreceptors
film camera, makes sense. - like sensitive chip CCD chip
cell phone. surface light pattern imaged optics
eye, now got array sensors capturing information
creating bitmap essentially, now neural signals distributed across surface
retina. known going 150 years ago, couple types
photoreceptors cones rods. look little bit closely, three types cones,
transformation electromagnetic radiation neural signals
thought take place. turns last photopigment end
retina, innermost part retina, so-called ganglion cells are.
cells talk brain, ones actually can communicate directly
information comes photoreceptors. got case
actually, output neurons didn't think business
directly sensitive light actually making photopigment, absorbing light,
converting neural signals sending brain. made pretty
surprising unexpected, many surprising things cells. - So,
relationship fly eye? - Right, link is, ask
photopigment now communicates downstream initial absorption event
get electrical signal, complex cellular process involves many chemical
steps. look photoreceptors eyes work, can see
cascade is, chain works. look eyes flies insects
invertebrates, similar kind chain. specifics signals get


absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -

absorption event pigment electrical response nervous
system can understand, characteristically different fuzzy furry creatures like
us insects example like fly. - see. - funny extra photoreceptors
wrong layer something completely different actually using
chemical cascade looks much like see fly photoreceptor,
see human photoreceptor, rod cone example.
sounds like primitive aspect biology maintain. - Exactly right,
exactly. - despite fact dogs can't see many colors can cats
can't see many colors can, extravagant stuff seeing color
got pigment sitting wrong not wrong, different part
eye sending processing light differently. - Right. - sending
information brain. So, cells do? Presumably,
reason. - are, interesting thing that, one cell type like carrying one
kind signal call brightness signal essentially, can many things
brain. - say brightness signal mean that, like right now,
cells cells? course. - do. - joking, hope cells
eye. paying attention bright overall, not paying
attention instance edge area else going room. - Right,
difference knowing objects table knowing
whether bright enough daylight right now. nervous system
need know whether daylight right now? Well, one thing needs know
circadian clock. travel across time zones Europe, now internal clock
thinks California time, rotation earth different part planet.
rising setting sun not body anticipating. got
internal representation rotation earth brain,
circadian system keeping time. now played trick nervous
system, put different place sun rising quote wrong
time. Well, not good you, right? got get back track. One
things system does, sends oh, daylight now signal brain,
compares internal clock. not right, tweaks clock gradually
get jet lag feel back track again. - jet lag case makes
lot sense me, presumably, elements didn't evolve jet lag. - Right. - So,
day-to-day basis? - Right, well one way think
that, clock not just brain, cells, almost cells


body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish

them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify

synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new
problems ways nervous system things hadn't thought about,
call you. please forgive calls past, present future unless change
number. even do, calling.

body, oscillating, all. - got local little clocks them. -
got local little clocks themselves, clocks. need synchronized
appropriately, whole thing built biological machinery. actually
beautiful story gene expression can control gene expression, set
right, can set little thing just sort hums along particular
frequency. case humming along 24 hours, 'cause earth
rotates built biology. great, reality is, clock
can good. mean, talking biology here. not precision
engineering, can little bit off. - Well, also brain, doesn't
access regular unerring signal? - Well, absence rising setting
sun doesn't, put someone cave, biological clock will keep time
within handful minutes 24 hours, no problem one day. went
without correction, eventually phase actually one
things blind patients often complain about. got retinal blindness
insomnia. [indistinct] Exactly, not synchronized, clock there,
drifting phase clock's good 24.2 hours 23.8 hours little
little drifting. need synchronization signal. even never across
time zones course didn't back Savannah stayed within walking
distance were, still need synchronizer, 'cause otherwise,
nothing actually confirm

00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers

rising setting sun is, trying synchronize
to. - fascinated circadian clock fact cells
body essentially 24-hour-ish clock them. - Right. - hear lot
circadian rhythms circadian clocks fact need light input
special neurons order set clock. never really heard described
clock works clock signals rest body liver
one thing stomach another. know done
work clock. just maybe briefly describe clock is,
does, top contour tells cells body do.
- Right, first thing say that, said, clock place.
tissues body clocks. - probably what, millions clocks


body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

body. - Yeah, say probably fair. millions cell types, might
millions clocks. role central pacemaker circadian system
coordinate these. little nucleus, little collection nerve cells
brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus SCN, sitting funny place
rest structures nervous system get direct retinal input. sitting
hypothalamus, can think sort great coordinator drives
and. - source pleasures problems. - Right. -
problems. - Yes, really is. sort deep brain things drive
things. freezing cold, put coat, shiver, things
coordinated hypothalamus. pathway talking retina
peculiar cells encoding light intensity, sending signals
directly center surrounded centers control autonomic
nervous system hormonal systems. part visual system
doesn't really reach level consciousness, not something think about,
happening radar kind time signal working way
central clock coordinating center. Now happens not well understood,
clear neural center ability communicate
parts brain neural center. clearly, circuits
involve connections neurons conventional. addition, quite
clear also sort humeral effects things oozing
cells center maybe circulation just diffusing brain
extent can also affect neurons elsewhere. hypothalamus uses
everything control rest body. true, supracosmetic nucleus
circadian center well, can get fingers autonomic nervous system,
humeral system course, centers brain organize coordinated
rational behavior. understand correctly, group cells,
suprachiasmatic nucleus, got 24-hour rhythm, rhythm less matched
going external world specialized set neurons eye.
master clock SCN, releases things blood humeral signals go
various places body. said autonomic system regulating
less alert calm are, well thinking cognition.
love talk autonomic part, presumably melatonin,
adrenaline clock impacting autonomic system,
alert calm feel? - Right, pathways suprachiasmatic


nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish

them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify

synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible

nucleus can access parasympathetic sympathetic nervous system. - Just
people know sympathetic nervous system one tends make us
alert, parasympathetic nervous system portion autonomic nervous
system makes us feel calm. - Right. - broadcasting. Right, first approximation,
right? So, systems within grasp circadian system
hypothalamic circuits. One circuits will think, particular interest
listeners pathway involves sympathetic branch
autonomic nervous system fight flight system actually
circuitous route innervating pineal gland sitting middle brain. -
so-called third eye. - Right, is. - get back called
third eye, because, yeah. - interesting thing. - can't call something
third eye just. - Just leave there. - Just leave there. - Right. - Right. - Anyway,
major source melatonin body. - light comes eye. - Yes. -
Passed off suprachiasmatic nucleus essentially, not light itself, signal
representing light. - Sure. - SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus can impact
melatonin system. - Right. - Via pineal? - Right, way seen that,
measure melatonin level course day,
hour hour, see really low day, high night.
get middle night go bathroom turn bright full
fluorescent light, melatonin level slammed floor. Light directly impacting
hormonal levels mechanism just described. one
routes light can act hormonal status pathways
completely beyond normally think about, right? thinking
things bathroom. Oh, toothbrush, tube toothpaste.
meanwhile, system just counting photons saying oh wow, lot
photons right now shut melatonin release. - one main
reasons encouraged people avoid bright light exposure middle
night. Not just blue light, bright light wavelength, myth
blue light optimal signal activating pathway
shutting melatonin, wavelength light can shut down.
correct thinking light bright enough. - Right. - doesn't matter blue
light, green light, purple light, even red light. - Right. - going slam melatonin
ground not good thing happen middle night. -
Right. - Correct? Right, yeah, light will affect system extent, blue


light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

light somewhat effective, don't fool thinking use red
light means avoiding effect, certainly still there. certainly,
bright, it'll effective driving system dim blue light be. -
Interesting, lot people wear blue blockers. - Right. - kind odd twist
misinformation there, lot people wear blue blockers middle day,
basically makes no sense middle day want
get lot bright light including blue light eyes, correct? - Absolutely,
not just reasons talking terms circadian effects,
major effects light mood. seasonal affective disorder apparently,
essentially reflection system reverse. living northern
climes not getting much light middle winter
Stockholm, might prone depression phototherapy might just ticket
direct effect light mood, example
don't enough light problem. think exactly right. not
like good bad you, kind light makes
difference. Yeah, general rule thumb living by, get much
bright light eyes ideally sunlight anytime want alert. - Right. -
exactly opposite want asleep. - Yeah. - getting drowsy. -
aspects spin

00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight

way beyond conversation now things like this. turns
incidence myopia. - Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. strongly related
amount time kids spend outdoors. - direction effect? -
spend time outdoors, less nearsightedness have. - not
viewing things distance, getting lot blue light,
sunlight? - great question, not fully resolved epidemiological,
basis epidemiological finding is, one possibility amount light
make think melanopsin system again. might well question
accommodation process focus near far things
never outdoors, everything nearby. outdoors, focusing far, is. -
unless phone? - Right, exactly. - tremendous amount
interest days watches things count steps. beginning realize


probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible

probably device can count photons day. - Right. -
can also count photons night tell us hey, getting many photons,
going shut melatonin night, not getting enough photons, today
didn't get enough bright light, whether not artificial light sunlight.
guess that, put? guess put top head
probably want someplace outward facing? - Right, probably need many
photons much retina possible recruit much system
possible. - thinking effects

00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image

non-image forming pathway involves special cells eye
SCN, paper years ago looking retinal input area brain
fancy name peri-habenular, names don't necessarily matter
important effects mood aspects light. Maybe tell us
little bit peri-habenular? - Oh, wow, fancy term, think
way think this, chunk brain sitting part bigger chunk
really linker peripheral sensory input kinds, virtually kinds,
whether auditory input tactile input visual input region brain
cortex allows think things make plans around
integrate kind thing. So, known pathway gets
retina sort linker center called thalamus, then.
[indistinct] Exactly, want arrive destination. Right now grand
central now can thing 'cause cortex.
standard pattern. sensory input coming periphery, got
peripheral elements initial stages of. - eye, ear, nose. -
skin fingertips, right? taste buds tongue taking raw
information pre-processing maybe early circuits are.
eventually, signals pass gateway cortex
thalamus. known years, decades, many decades, major
throughput pathway retina cortex ends up. ends
visual cortex. pat back head receiving center
main pathway retina cortex. wait minute, more. little
side pathway goes different part linking thalamus center. [indistinct]


- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled

a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new
problems ways nervous system things hadn't thought about,
call you. please forgive calls past, present future unless change
number. even do, calling.

- Like local train. - Yeah. - grand central to. - weird part
neighborhood, right? completely different, like little trunk line branches off
goes hinterlands going part linker center
talking completely different part cortex way front, frontal lobe, much
involved things like planning, self-image or. - Self-image literally, one. -
Views oneself, feel good yourself, plan next Thursday.
high level center highest level nervous system
region getting input pathway mostly worked function
[indistinct] Tara's Lab. know podcast. - didn't talk
path. - pathway right. Dale Fernandez [indistinct] folks
work them, able show pathway doesn't just exist get
weird place. activate kind wrong time day, animals can become
depressed. silence right circumstances, weird lighting cycles
normally make act sort depressed, no longer effect. -
sounds like pathway eye unusual train route
structure call thalamus, front brain relates things
self-perception, kind higher level functions. find really interesting,
think think fancy, well, primitive rather,
neurons don't pay attention shapes things, instead brightness think
well, regulates melatonin circadian clock, mood, hunger, really kind
vegetative stuff will. - Right. - interesting think lot people
experience depression not just people live Scandinavia middle winter,
much divorced normal interactions light. also makes
realize intrinsically photosensitive cells set clock et cetera,
involved lot things.

00:41:03 Sense Balance

seem regulate dozen different basic functions. want ask
different aspect visual system now, one relates sense
balance. love boats hate them. love ocean shore,
get incredibly seasick, awful. think going get seasick think
much. [laughs] went boat trip, came back actually got motion sick
wasn't seasick 'cause rafting. system somehow gets messed


up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

up. always tell us feeling sick look horizon et cetera, et cetera. -
Right. - link visual system balance system
make us nauseous sometimes world moving way not
accustomed to? - Right. - realize big question, involves eye
movement, et cetera. - Right. - maybe just walk simplest layers
vision, vestibular, so-called balance system maybe can piece system
together people can understand, also give
tools adjusting nausea vestibular system whack. -
Cool, first thing think vestibular system designed allow
see detect sense moving world, world.
funny one movement relationship world sense,
yet sort interoceptive sense really end sensing
movement body. - Okay, interoception probably delineate
people focusing internal state opposed something outside
you. - Right. - gravity sensing system. - Well, partly gravity sensing system
sense gravity force acting moving
world opposite direction. - right, now got explain that. got explain
me. - Okay, basically idea that, leave gravity inside, just
sitting car, passenger seat driver hits accelerator start
moving forward, sense that. eyes closed, sense it. ears
plugged in, eyes close, still know it. - Yeah, many people take off
plane like dreading flight know plane taking
off. - Sure, vestibular system talking, anything jostles
current position right now will detected vestibular system pretty
much. complicated system, basically inner ear close
hearing. - put there. don't know. - don't really know,
sort derived. [indistinct] - Now just kidding. steal friend Russ Van
Gelder's explanation, weren't consulted design phase no one. -
great [indistinct]. - interesting ear. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah, deep
served nerve actually serves hearing system. One
way think hearing system vestibular self-motion sensing
system really detecting signal way hairy cells
exciting. [indistinct] - Yeah, sort got little cilia sticking off surfaces.
depending way bend those, cells will either inhibited excited,


not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible

not even neurons talk neurons neuron-like process off
go. Now got auditory signal sensing things bouncing around
cochlea is. - Sound waves. - Sympathetically bouncing eardrum
symmetrically sound waves world. case vestibular
apparatus, evolution built system detects motion say fluid going
hairs. put sensor like tube fluid filled, now got
sensor will activated rotate tube around axis passes
middle it, just listening won't able. [indistinct] -
thinking three hula hoops. - Right, three hoops. - One standing up, one lying
ground. - Right. - one way. - Three directions,
people fly will talk roll pitch kind thing. three axes
encoding just like the. [indistinct] - Sort yes, no always say
puppy head tilt. - Yeah, puppy tilt. - one. point that,
brain eventually going able unpack sensors telling
just rotated head much way three types cones
talking reading incoming photons wavelength domain
differently, if. - Red, green, blue. - Yeah, can compare trust get red,
green, blue. basic idea three sensors array properly,
now can tell rotating head left right, sensory
signal coming back brain confirming just made movement
will. - plane? plane, completely
stationary plane's moving. - Right. - head hasn't moved. - Right. - just
moving forward, gravity constant. - Exactly. - know accelerating? -
happening now brain sensing motion, brain smart enough
also ask itself, will movement come outside? now
terms sort understanding vestibular signal means, got
embedded context tried do, sensory systems
telling happening. - see, interesting. not conscious
least conscious, not conscious, definitely fast, right?
moment plane starts moving, know didn't get chair run
forward. - Right. - not really thinking getting chair just know.
- guess way think that, nervous system quote, aware many
levels gets way cortex thinking it, talking
it, cortical. lower levels brain don't require actually


actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not

00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures

somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish

marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal

a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make

looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just

reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify

synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting

release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time

links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new
problems ways nervous system things hadn't thought about,
call you. please forgive calls past, present future unless change
number. even do, calling.

actively think just thing also made aware, right? lot
happening surface thinking, reflexes. - Okay,
got gravity sensing system? - Right. - nodding
listening yes movement head, no movement head tilting
head side side. - Right. - said knowledge whether not
activation system comes movements, something acting upon
like plane moving. - Right. - combined signals. so,
visual information information visual world combined balance
information? - Right, yeah. guess maybe best way think two
systems work together, think happens suddenly rotate
head left. suddenly rotate head left, eyes actually
rotating right. Automatically, complete darkness.
infrared camera watched complete darkness, can't see anything.
Rotating head left, eyes rotate right. vestibular
system saying, going try compensate head rotation. eyes still
looking place. useful, well, always that,
image world retina will pretty stable time actually
helps vision. - built cameras image stabilization 'cause
move, take picture phone, blurry, not clear? - Well actually,
might want get better phone, now software better
apps will kind image stabilization post-hoc registration
images bouncing around, say edge house here, get
aligned images. may not aware using good new
phone walk around landscape hold phone,
image stabilization going on. built standard cinematic technology now,
tried handheld camera, things bouncing around, things
unwatchable, wouldn't able really understand going
scene. brain works really hard mostly stabilize image world
retina course moving world can't stabilize everything.
can stabilize time, better can see.
scanning scene looking around things, making rapid eye
movements short periods time just rest, not
ones that. ever watch hummingbird, exactly thing
feeder, right? [indistinct] body. going make quick movement,



00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible

00:50:43 Pigeons Bob Heads, Motion Sickness

going stable. watch pigeon walking sidewalk,
funny head bobbing thing. really doing, racking head back
neck body goes forward image visual world stays static. -
it? - Yes, seen funny chicken videos YouTube,
right? - take chicken move head stays one place,
thing. animals trying hard keep image world stable
retina much time possibly can. got
move, make fast, make quick stabilize again. - pigeons
head back? - is, yeah. - Wow. - Yeah. - just need pause second
digest that, amazing. case people aren't. Well, no reason people
know here, essentially, building
sensory light onto eye, make color brain integration
circadian clock, melatonin, et cetera. now talking
multi-sensory multimodal combining one sense vision another sense
balance. - Right. - turns pigeons know do,
pigeons know keep head back walk forward. - Right. - right,
gets us issue motion sickness. - Right. - don't go
boat. Anytime go New York, sit Uber cab back. looking
phone car driving, feel nauseous time arrive destination. -
Right. - always try look front windshield, told helps
little tiny window. - Right. - end feeling slightly less sick that.
going vision balance system causes kind nausea?
actually, keep talking this. [indistinct] [laughs] don't throw easily,
reason motion sickness real thing me. - problem lot
people. think fundamental problem typically, get motion sick
call visual vestibular conflict. is, two sensory systems talking
brain moving world. long agree
fine. driving, body senses moving forward. vestibular
system picking acceleration car, visual system seeing
consequences forward motion sweeping scene past you. Everything
honky-dory, right, no problem. headed forward looking


cell phone, retina seeing? retina seeing stable image
screen. absolutely no motion that. - motion just
emotion like movie. - playing game watching video, football
game, motion uncoupled actually happening body. brain
doesn't like that, brain likes everything aligned. not, going
complain you. - making feel nauseous. - making feel nauseous
maybe change behavior. getting. - getting punished. - Yeah,
setting up. [indistinct] - Right. - vestibular? - learn. - Visuals. [laughs]
time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons

synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible

time, love it. love idea reward signals done lot discussion
podcast things like dopamine reward things, also punishment
signals love example. Well, maybe marching little bit along
pathway, visual input combined balance input. occur,
maybe 'cause hint occurs. tell us little bit
kind mysterious little mini-brain call cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah.
way tried describe cerebellum students that, serves sort like
air traffic control system functions air travel. system
complicated really dependent great information. taking information
everything happening everywhere not sensory systems,
listening little centers elsewhere brain computing
going next forth. just ravenous kind
information. - really like little mini-brain. - is, got access
signals. really important role coordinating shaping movements,
suddenly eliminated air traffic control system, planes still take off land
might unhappy accidents process. cerebellum kind
like that. not paralyzed cerebellum gone
still motor neurons, still ways talk muscles, still reflex
centers, not like sensory laws still
cortex getting beautiful signals can think about, wouldn't
coordinating things well anymore. timing input output might off.
trying practice new athletic move like overhead serve tennis,
just terrible learning. sequences muscle movements
feedback sensory apparatus let really hit ball exactly
wanted nth rep, right? Now 1000th rep something get
much better it. cerebellum involved things like motor learning


refining precisions movement get want go
reach glass champagne don't knock stop short. [indistinct] -
People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.
just one domains sensory motor integration takes place there. -
stay off phone Ubers. boat, essentially look
much possible act driving machine. - Right. - That'd weird
passenger seat pretending driving machine. always feel better
sitting front seat passenger. - Right, visual world can
see actually one motion think. - stay
inner ear minute continue march around nervous system.
take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal

looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke

people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

People selective damage cerebellum. - Absolutely. - familiar
with. Well, Korsakoff's different, right? Isn't B vitamin deficiency chronic
alcoholics? - Right. - tend walk kind bow-legged can't coordinate
movements. not memory bodies also cerebellum? -
not sure cerebellar involvement there. typical thing patient
cerebral stroke tumor example, might not steady
feet dynamics situation standing street car no handle pull
hold to, might not good adjusting little movements car.
kind tremor can occur reaching things,
reach little far correct come back, things like that.
common neurological phenomenon actually. Cerebellar ataxia
neurologists call it, can happen not just cerebellar damage, damage
tracts feed information cerebellum. - Right, private structure. -
Exactly, output cerebellum. - so, cerebellum lot visual
balance information combined. - key place cerebellum,
really one oldest parts. - terms flocculus. - flocculus, right. critical
place cerebellum visual vestibular information comes together
recording just kinds movements talking about. image stabilizing
network happening there. learning happening well.
vestibular apparatus little bit damaged somehow, visual system actually
talking cerebellum saying problem here, error,
cerebellum learning better increasing output vestibular system
compensate whatever loss was. little error correction system sort
typical cerebellar function can happen many, many different domains.

take off plane land sometimes middle there, ears get


clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons

interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -

clogged least ears get clogged, pressure buildup
various tubes

01:00:03 Popping Ears

inner ear, et cetera, get this. years ago, good friend Harvey
Karten, another world-class neuroanatomist gave lecture talked
plugging nose blowing versus plugging nose sucking
done different times depending whether not taking off landing.
always see people trying unpop ears. - Right. - scuba diving
learn without necessarily can just kind moving jaw
now 'cause done little bit diving. story there? don't
get differences atmospheric pressure, et cetera, taking off
ears plugged, recently ascended, plane take off, ears plugged, plug
nose blow out, plug nose suck in? - Right, basic idea
that, ears feel bad going area higher pressure,
pressurize cabin pressure surface planet,
eardrums will bending don't like that. push
hurt even more. - good description pressure goes going
bend in. - Bend reverse true go area low pressure.
knew started drive mountain side pressure's getting lower
lower outside, now air behind eardrum ballooning out. - Yep. - Right?
just question trying get pressure less pressure behind
eardrum little tube comes back throat
there. force pressure tube, going putting air
pressure compartment. - counter it. - not enough sucking
going way. reality, think long open passageway, think
pressure differential going solve problem. think actually
blow not supposed to. - Okay, just hold nose blow
air out, hold nose suck the. - Right. - Effect either way fine? - think so.
- Excellent, just won $100 Harvey Karten. [laughs] - Thank much,
lot. Harvey used teach neuroanatomy together like don't think
matters, thank much, split you. - Okay. [laughs] -
important stuff. true hear this. doesn't matter either way. - no expert


area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

area. - Don't worry. - Don't quote me. - not going to, well, going quote
you. But, okay, talked inner ear,

01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight

talked cerebellum. want talk area brain rarely
discussed midbrain. - Yeah. - don't know, midbrain
area beneath cortex. guess never really defined cortex kind outer
layers outer layers least mammalian brain human brain.
midbrain super interesting, controls lot unconscious stuff, reflexes, et
cetera. phenomenon even called blind sight. please
tell us midbrain does, world sight? - Yeah,
lot pieces there. think first thing say is, imagine nervous
system mind's eye, see big honking brain little wand
dangles vertical column spinal cord kind visual
impression. imagine starting spinal cord working
way big magnificent brain enter skull,
get little place spinal cord kind thickens out. still sort
long, skinny trunk-like feeling. - like paddle spoon shape. - Right, starts
spread little bit 'cause evolutionists packed interesting
goodies processing information generating movement. beyond
tween brain talking about. linker brain diencephalon really means
brain. - Oh, thought said tween. - Well, is, yes. - No, no, no,
between. Between. - Between. [indistinct] - said tween. - Yeah, between,
brain name means. linker spinal cord
periphery grand centers cortex. midbrain talking
last bit enlarged sort spinal cordy thing skull, really
brain stem call it. last bit get relay
cortex midbrain. really important visual center there, called
superior colliculus. similar center brains vertebrate animals
frog example lizard, called optic tectum
center, non-mammalian vertebrates, really main visual center.
don't really call visual cortex although something sort
like that. action terms interpreting visual input


organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range

organizing behavior around that. can sort think region brain stem
reflex center can reorient animal's gaze body maybe even attention
particular regions space around animal kinds
reasons. might predator just showed one corner forest pick
trying avoid it. - just movement. - movement, right?
might suddenly something splats page reading novel
eye reflexively looks it. don't think that, reflex. -
throw ball not expecting it? - Right. - just reach try grab
touch not. handled midbrain? - Well, probably not midbrain
although itself, going involve limb movements, movement
arm body. - ducking something's suddenly thrown
head? - Sure, right, things like will certainly brainstem component,
midbrain component, something looms duck. may not superior
colliculus talking now, might another part visual midbrain.
centers emerged early evolution brains like handle
complicated visual events significance animal terms space,
space? fact, center actually gets input kinds
sensory systems take information external world particular locations
might want either avoid approach things according
significance you. get input touch system, get input
auditory system. work rattlesnakes, get input part
warm sensors face, little pits face. - work baby
rattlesnakes, right? - adults. - Oh, wasn't trying diminish danger.
thought reason little ones. - No. - world work
rattlesnakes? - Well, version extra receptive sensory
system looking world using completely different set
sensors. using sensors feel warmth face
stood front bonfire. Except, evolution given nice specialized
system lets image heat's coming from. can sort
anyway, right? walk around fire, can feel fire heat
hitting face. - primary way detect prey? - one one
major ways. fact, use vision well bring two systems
together place tectum regions brain stem, midbrain. -
tongue jutting snakes? - don't know. may old factory,


maybe. - sniffing air tongue? - Yeah, may be, 'cause.
- drive told flies actually taste things feet. - do, yeah. -
weird. - Yeah, taste receptors lots funny places. want
pause just one second get back midbrain. think
interesting seriousness taste receptors feet, heat sensors, tongues
shutting snakes vision integration that, really speaks
fact sensory neurons trying gather information stuff
system can make meaningful decisions actions. really doesn't matter
whether not coming eyes ears nose bottoms feet,
end, just electricity flowing in. sounds like placed animal,
always feels weird call fly animal. creatures, animals.
placed different locations different animals depending particular needs
animal. - Right, much powerful nervous systems can also cross-
correlate across sensory systems? got weak signal one sensory
system, not quite sure something there. weak signal
another sensory system telling locations little bit interesting.
might something got two together got
corroboration. brain now says much likely going
something worth paying attention to. - Right, maybe feeling heat one
side face also smell something baking oven. - Right. - now there's,
neither particularly strong, said, corroboration. - Right.
corroboration occurring midbrain. - Right, throw things
conflict, now brain confused may emotion sickness comes
from. great have, brain, great many sources information
can have, just like spy journalist, don't want much
information can get there, things conflict,
problematic, right? sources giving different information going
on.

01:10:44 Tilted Motion Feels Good

Now got problem hands, publish? - midbrain
fascinating. don't want eject us midbrain go back vestibular
system, question forgot ask vestibular system is,


many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
neurosciences. - can put links
like. - Right. - basic neuroscience. - Right. - good friend Dick Masland,
late Richard, people call Dick Masland good book. forget title
moment. sitting behind somewhere shelf vision
nervous systems work. pretty accessible book general public. - Right - Yeah. -
Right, that, many sources there. mean, Wikipedia great way.
particular question visual function, say means, head
Wikipedians get first look follow references there, go
library, many ways get it, exciting field now.
many, mean, particular realm special you, experience, strengths,
passions, field neuroscience devoted that. know somebody
got neurological problem psychiatric problem, branch
neuroscience devoted trying understand

01:49:04 Book Suggestion, Berson Appreciation

solve kinds problems line. feel buzz, exciting time
get involved. - Great, great resources people can access
anywhere zero-cost need internet connection. aside that, put
links some. remembering, Dick's book called, "We Know
See It." - Right, one heroes. - Yeah, wonderful colleague unfortunately


lost years ago. listen David, wonderful. - blast. -
really appreciate taking time people probably realize now
incredible wealth knowledge entire nervous system, today just hit
top contour number different areas give flavor different ways
nervous system works organized put together, areas
talking one another. love incredible
educator taught many students years. also personally
friends, also time want touch beauty nervous system,
rarely lose touch it. anytime want touch start thinking new
problems ways nervous system things hadn't thought about,
call you. please forgive calls past, present future unless change
number. even do, calling.

many people including me, despite motion sickness cabs,
sense pleasure moving space getting tilted relative
gravitational pull earth? growing skateboarding, people like
corner cars, corner bikes, maybe people done running dance.
moving space getting tilted lot surfers around here.
Getting tilted can tap pleasure centers. idea
feel like? - no clue. - dopaminergic input system? - Well,
dopaminergic system gets lot places. pretty much extent
everywhere cortex lot frontal lobe course, just
starters. basically dopaminergic innervation places central nervous
system. potential dopamine urging involvement really no
clue tilting phenomenon. - People pay money go roller coasters. - Right,
well, think may much thrill anything. - Sure. falling
reflex robust us visual world's going fast usually
means falling. - Right. - people like that, people don't. - Right.
kids tolerate lot sort vestibular craziness spinning around
dropped. - friends, always worries little bit throw kids.
not recommending anyone this. little like throwing kids really far
back forth, kids seem love it. - Yeah, yeah, son loved shaken
vigorously, thing calm sometimes. -
Interesting, yeah, guessing can guess maybe activation
reward systems from. - Yeah. - moving space. - Well, think
rewarding able move space unhappy people
used suddenly aren't able that, sense agency,
right? can choose move world tilt, not
moving world, certain amount finesse, maybe
is. can feel like master movement way
wouldn't going straight. just blowing smoke here, right? - Yeah, well,
can speculate, fine.

01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions

couldn't help ask question. Okay, move pun intended back
midbrain, midbrain combining different signals reflexive action.


point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

point become deliberate action? look something want
want pursue it, going go toward many times deliberate
decision. - Right, gets slippery think, try
imagine different parts brain working problem staying alive
surviving world, working problem simultaneously,
not one right answer that. one way think that, high
levels nervous system well designed override otherwise
automatic movement inappropriate. imagine invited tea
queen hands fancy Wedgewood teacup thin. -
Wedgewood teacup? - Yes, hot tea burning hand,
probably will try find way put back saucer rather just
dropping floor queen. trying appropriate
that. ways reining automatic behaviors going
maladaptive. also want reflex work quickly thing going
save you. looming object coming head, don't time think
that. interplay hierarchically organized centers nervous
system lowest level. got automatic sensors centers reflex arcs
will keep safe even don't time think it, got
higher center saying, well, maybe well maybe shouldn't
all, right? different levels operating simultaneously
need bi-directional communication high-level, cognitive centers, decision-
making one hand, low-level helpful reflexive centers,
little bit rigid, little hard-wired need nuance.
things operating tandem real time, time brains sometimes
listen one other. heard people sports talking messing
play 'cause thought it. Thinking hard it. partly
already trained cerebellum hit fastball right middle. - Right,
start looking something new different, going mess reflexive
swing. - Right, trying think physics ball coming you,
already missed, right? not using your, reps built
kind knowledge want rely don't enough time
contemplate. - important great segue

01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & “2 Marshmallow Test”



like discuss next basal ganglia. really interesting
area brain involved go-type commands behaviors instructing us
things no-go preventing us things. much motor learning
skill execution not saying wrong thing sitting still class use
tea queen example feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior
sometimes activating behavior. - Right. - tremendous amount online
attention devoted trying get people motivated. isn't main focus
podcast. touch underlying neural circuits motivation dopamine
forth. much people struggle elements around failure
pay attention. - Right. - challenges paying attention essentially like
putting blinders getting soda straw view world
maintaining work something sort trying get action.
course, carried many neural circuits not just basal ganglia.
basal ganglia, primary roles controlling go type
behavior no-go type behavior? - Yeah, basal ganglia sitting deep
call forebrains highest levels brain. sort cousins
cerebral cortex talked sort highest level brain,
thing thinking with. - cerebral cortex refined cousins
got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just

got the. - Right. - brute, yeah. - Yeah. probably totally unfair, but. -
right, like basal ganglia. can relate brutish parts brain. little
bit hypothalamus, little bit basal ganglia, sure. - need all, need all.
area brain gotten lot bigger cortex gotten bigger
deeply intertwined cortical function. cortex can't really needs
without help basal ganglia vice versa. really intertwined.
way can think logically saying, ability withhold
behavior execute it, decide do? Well, cortex going
thinking you. looking contingencies
situation decide crazy move, really smart investment right now
what? - don't want go run morning, going make go
run, great time run know need get back
kind want go another mile. - mean, another great example that,
marshmallow test little kids. can get two marshmallows hold off just
30 seconds initially, can one right away. can wait 30 seconds,


got two. no go cortex saying, really like two
one. not going get two unless can not reach
one. got hold off action result cognitive
process. cortex involved major way. - Yeah, recall
experiment, kids used variety tools. distract themselves.
particularly related kid just put right next marshmallows
kids covered eyes, count sing. Yeah,
cortical, right? Coming novel strategy, simple example
using here. course, play anytime someone decides want go
watch motivational speech something just Steve Jobs commencement speech just
get motivated engage day. - take new job? got great
benefits, lousy part country. - think people
harder time running go no-go circuits people seem low
activation energy say, just, task, just lean
task. - Right. - Whereas people getting task completion things sort
challenging them? - Yeah, think really just another, special case
general phenomenon brains complicated. brains
result genetics experience, genes different genes
experiences different experiences. things easy
hard us won't necessarily aligned, might just happen just
are, point that, dealt certain set cards, certain set
genes, handed brain, don't choose brain handed you.
stuff can it. can learn new skills act
differently show restraint kind relevant talking
here. maybe show less restraint problem buttoned down,
never fun life loosen little bit. - Thank you, appreciate
that. - Yeah. - Yeah. [laughs] David's always encouraging little fun
life. [laughs] basil ganglia kind disciplinarian sort
instructor conductor sorts, right? Go, no-go, quiet, start now. - wish
knew basal ganglia do. sense that, system key
implementing plans get cooked cortex, also influence
plans cortex dishing major source information
cortex. becomes almost impossible figure computation begins
ends things interacting


complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble
motivation go type functions, mostly busy wish
time goes speak. think circuits genuine plasticity
them? - Absolutely, everybody knows learned time wait two
marshmallows, right? don't instant gratification time.
willing job sometimes isn't favorite job comes territory
want salary comes end week end month,
right? can defer gratification. can choose not say thing know
going inflame partner create meltdown next week. learn
control, think skills like can get better
practice them. think choosing spontaneously, kind mental
practice, discipline, way building skill want have. - Yeah, find
something engage no-go type situation, next time
next time find move reflexively, little gap
consciousness

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great

complex network, it. whole network, not one leader
follower. - Right, course, yeah, structures
discussing working parallel. - Right. - lot changing crosstalk.
somewhat sick habit David. Every day try 21 no-gos. want
reach phone, try not just see can prevent engaging
behavior, reflexive, something want deliberate choice,
certainly allow it. - Right. - don't tend much trouble

01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex

can make decision whether not really best use time.
sometimes wonder whether not business around attention certainly
case ADHD clinical diagnosed ADHD. issue around focus
attention really people just not really learned short circuit reflex.
much makes us different rattlesnakes, well, actually
deliberate, animals ability suppress reflex. - Yeah,
well, cortex. say forebrain. Cortex basal ganglia working
together sitting top lizard brain giving great adaptive
reflexes help survive. just hope don't get surprising case
thing reflex telling actually exactly wrong thing make


mistake, right? [indistinct] Right, cortex for. adding nuance
context experience, past association human beings obviously, learning
others communication. - Well, was, went right
going go. talk cortex. worked way so-called
neuraxis aficionados will know, cortex. seat
higher consciousness, self-image, planning action. mentioned, cortex
isn't just that, got regions involved things. maybe
staying vision, talk little bit visual cortex. told
amazing story visual cortex somewhat sad story unfortunately
someone stroke visual cortex. Maybe share story
think illustrates many important principles cortex does. -
Right, visual cortex say projection screen. first place
information streaming retina thalamus connecting linker gets
played highest level brain see. representation, map
things going visual world brain. describe scene
friend, using chunk brain able put words coming
different part cortex objects movements colors see
world. key part visual experience can describe
things seeing, looking visual cortex, is. - just ask
quick question? right now looking face. - Right. -
talking, neurons brain less configuration face
active move about. close eyes just imagine,
time way David. close eyes imagine David Berson's face.
[laughs] don't tend often, maybe should. get point, now
using visualization look like way memory. - Right. - image
neurons brain, activity neurons resemble activity neurons
present open eyes look actual face? - deep
question, don't really full. - seems like. [indistinct] - Yes, except
talking looking detail activity neurons human brain not
easy kind animal model. bottom line that,
spatial representation visual world late map visual world lay
surface cortex. thing surprising that, not one map,
actually dozens maps. - maps do? - Well, don't really
full accounting either, looks little bit like diversification


output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love

somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done

output neurons retina, ganglion cells talking before.
different types ganglion cells encoding different kinds information
visual world, talk ones encoding brightness. ones
encoding motion color kinds things, kinds specializations
different representations visual world cortex seem true. complex
story, don't whole picture yet, look parts brain
much important things like reaching things space around you.
parts cortex really important making associations particular
visual things looking now significance. object, can
me, can use it? - really specialized areas cortex like
neurons respond particular faces, neurons don't know can help
understand relative specific object? - Right,
properties neurons extracted detected recording activity single
neurons experimental system. going actually perceive
grandmother's face, much complicated question clearly involves
hundreds thousands probably millions neurons acting cooperative way.
can pick one little element complicated system see
responding differentially certain kinds visual patterns think
seeing glimpse part process recognize
grandmother's face. long way complete description certainly
isn't going level magic single neuron special stuff
recognize grandmother, going pattern activity across many,
many cells resonating kind special way will represent internal
memory mother. - really incredible? - Yeah. - mean every time
deep dive time time, kind like march
nervous system explore different aspects life experiences handled
organized. many decades this, still boggles
mind collection neurons one seven active particular sequence
gives memory particular face run backwards seven one, gives
a, rattlesnake pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. - talking
earlier. sounds, true lot multi-purposing circuitry,
like can't say one area brain another area brain B.
areas can multitask multiple jobs. can moonlight. - Right, think
career, hard problem square fact things specialized


specific genes expressed specific neurons make make
synaptic connections certain neurons. particular synaptic
arrangement actually results processing information useful animal
survive, right? not either big undifferentiated network cells
looking one never going tell anything extreme one hand,
case everything hardwired every neuron one function
happens one place brain, way complicated interactive
interconnected that. - not hardwired soft-wired? - Both. - sort of,
don't know analogy substance work best David? - No
idea there, idea that, always network activity. always many, many
neurons involved yet tremendous specificity neurons might
might not participating distributed function like that, right? get
mind around fact specific non-specific
time. little tricky do, think kind truth lies. - Yeah,
example mentioned woman stroke
visual cortex,

01:33:33 Neuroplasticity

think speaks this. - Right. - share us story? - Sure,
point that, us see representations visual world
visual cortex. happens somebody become blind problems
eye, retina perhaps? big chunk cortex, really valuable
[indistinct] neural processing come expect input visual system
isn't anymore. might think fallow land, right? just
used nervous system pity, turns fact
used. case talking woman blind
early life risen ranks high level executive
secretarial position major corporation. extremely good braille
reading braille typewriter everything done.
apparently, stroke discovered work, collapsed brought
hospital. apparently, neurologist saw finally came said,
"I've got good news bad news." Bad news stroke, good news
area brain not even using visual cortex


know blind birth shouldn't issue here." problem was,
lost ability read braille. appears case
confirmed ways imaging experiments humans that, people
blind early birth, visual cortex gets repurposed center
processing tactile information. especially train good braille reader,
actually reallocating somehow real estate fingertips. part
cortex listening eyes. extreme level plasticity.
shows, visual cortex kind general purpose processing machine,
good spatial information skin fingers just another spatial sense
deprived input brain seems smart enough want put way
rewire use real estate something useful, case, reading braille. -
Incredible, somewhat tragic, incredible. least case tragic, yeah. -
informative. - informative. course can go way too. - Right. -
people can gain function particular modalities

01:36:27 Connectome?

like improved hearing tactile function absence vision. - Right. - Tell us
connectomes, hear genomes, proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms
days. - Yeah. - connectome valuable? - Yeah,
connectome actually now two meanings. refer one passion
right now. really trying understand structure nervous tissue
scale very, fine. - Smaller millimeter. - Way smaller millimeter,
nanometer less, 1,000 times smaller, actually million times smaller.
really, really tiny scale individual synapses individual neurons
even smaller like individual synaptic vesicles containing little packets
neurotransmitter going get released allow one neuron communicate
next. very, fine, notion that, section
section fine scale. theory complete description
chunk nervous tissue complete took enough time identify
boundaries cells are, come complete description
synaptic wiring chunk nervous tissue complete description
cells synapses cells are.
now essentially wiring diagram complicated piece tissue.


omics part exhaustiveness rather looking couple synapses
interesting two different cell types. looking synapses
cell types course massive avalanche data, right? -
genetics, genetics genomics idea getting
whole genome. - it. - don't really analogous word genetics,
connectivity [indistinct]. - Right. [indistinct] - Right, wanting
course crazy ambitious, gets fun. Really use
electron microscopy, high resolution microscopic imaging system new scale
way payoff terms understanding connectivity nervous system
just emerging, really think going revolutionize field
going able query circuits actually it, look hardware
way never possible before. - way describe people
take chunk kind cooked cold spaghetti. - Right. - slice
thin trying connect image slice edge
spaghetti figure ropes spaghetti belong which. - complete
description piece spaghetti touches piece spaghetti
something special obviously. - Meat sauces cell types
pesto around spaghetti cells, blood
vessels glial cells. so, good for? Maps great, always think
connectomics genomics proteomics, et cetera necessary, not sufficient. -
Right. Right, mean many cases go probe function
understand brain function finding neurons seem
firing association function observing. little little work
way now want know conductivity maybe anatomy
help you. connectomics approach least serial electron
microscopy reconstruction neurons approach, really allowing us frame questions
starting anatomy saying, see synaptic circuit here, prediction
cell types interact particular way, right? can
go probe physiology might right might wrong.
often not, looks like structure pointing us right direction.
case, using try understand circuit involved image
stabilization network talking about, keeping things stable retina
thing will respond certain speeds motion. cells circuit like slow
motion won't respond fast motion, come about? Well, able


probe circuitry, knew cells looked like, see cells
talking it, categorize cells might players
involved mechanism tuning thing slow speeds, said looks
like cell type went looked data bore up. anatomy
drove search particular cell type see connected
right place right cells. creates hypothesis lets go query
physiology, can go way well. always synergy
functional structural approaches gives lift. many cases,
anatomy little bit weak sister this. structure trying work
diagram haven't methods. Now methods exist whole
field expanding quickly, people want circuit diagrams
particular part nervous system working on. don't know cell
types connections, really understand machine works? -
Yeah, love is, don't know don't know. - Right. - scientists
don't ask questions, pose hypotheses. Hypotheses course
prediction wager time basically. - Right. - either turns
true not true, don't know particular cell type there, never
configuration life career exploration nervous system wager
hypothesis didn't know there. allows say ah,
little interesting little connection cell know interesting another cell
little mysterious interesting, going hypothesize blank,
blank blank go test that. absence connectomes,
never know cell lurking shadows. - Right, right, yeah.
just trying understand information flows biological machine,
want know things are. Neurotransmitters dumped terminals
one cell diffuse across space two cells kind
liquidy space hit receptors postsynaptic cell
impact. Sometimes not regular synapse, sometimes
neuromodulator like often talk podcast sort of. - Dopamine. -
Dopamine, exactly. Oozing space cells may acting
distance far released, right? don't know
release happening things might respond release
groping around dark. - Well, love
share listeners that, first time ever met David every time ever met


in-person least laboratory Brown, office, door closed,
drawing neurons connections. [laughs] somewhat unusual
somebody endowed full professor chairman department et cetera
many years hands-on work. Typically, stuff done
technicians graduate students postdocs. think fair say really
love looking nervous systems drawing accurate renditions
nervous systems organized thinking work. - Yeah, pure joy
me. mean, visual person, wife artist, look lot art together
just forms things gorgeous right. know form
sense function architecture connectivity computation
happens brain level even though don't fully understand
contexts, gives great joy 'cause working something visually
beautiful also deeply beautiful sort higher sort knowledge context,

01:45:20 Learn (More Brain)

about. - love it, well, final question, get asked often
people learn neuroscience, go pursuing maybe
education neuroscience stage life appropriate
current trajectory. advice young people, old people, anything
learn nervous system maybe formal
way? mean obviously, podcast, sources neuroscience
information there, young person thinks want understand
brain, want learn brain, tell them? - Well, great
question. many sources there. almost question
deal avalanche information there, think podcast great way
people learn nervous system accessible way.
much stuff not just that. mean, resources becoming
available average folks participate neuroscience research level.
famous Eyewire project Sebastian. - Oh yeah, maybe let us
Eyewire. - Yeah, connectomics situation clever
scientist realized physical work reconstruction neurons
electron micro-graphs, lot time involved. Many, many person hours
go come map want cells are,


clever setting context crowdsource
people interested getting little experience looking nervous tissue
participating research project learn little bit. -
living room. - living room. - put link Eyewire, also great
bridge just talking connectomics actually participating
research. - Right. - don't need graduate mentor anything like that. -
Right. coming actually interested building
people interested, want participate level don't necessarily
time resources get involved laboratory research can get exposed
participate actually contribute, think one thing. mean, just asking
questions people around know little bit point
right direction. book might like read, lots great popular
books accessible will give sense full range
