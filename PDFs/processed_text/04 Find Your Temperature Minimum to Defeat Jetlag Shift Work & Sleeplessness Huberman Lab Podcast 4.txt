07:05 - Night owls morning larks

Now may immediately thinking, well, heard night owls
mornings larks, sometimes called genetic polymorphisms, just
fancy name genetic variations make people want wake early
people want stay late teens want sleep more. Sure, true.
true regardless names give those. However, no escaping
fact human beings diurnal species. designed, literally, cells
circuits body constructed awake daytime asleep
night. know that? Well, wasn't consulted design phase,
certain many studies shown deviate far
diurnal schedule try become nocturnal, can pull off, serious health
effects, mental physical, start arise. not going spend much today
talking negative effects jet lag talk little bit it, negative
effects shift work, trying scare telling quite valid data
around depression, amnesia, dementia, terrible things happen
not sleeping well, rather like focus can



08:22 - “The perfect schedule”

arm tools. talk perfect schedule moment.
talk jet lag jet lag really represents push back jet lag,
shift clock faster, escape severe bad things can happen
jet lag. Including just feeling miserable traveling work vacation.
perfect day? look like circadian sleep-wakefulness
standpoint? summarize said three previous podcast
episodes, well now countless Instagram posts. deal. basically want
get much light, ideally sunlight, much light eyes period
24 hour cycle want awake, want alert.
want get little light eyes times 24 hour cycle want
asleep drowsy falling asleep. much enough? Well, don't want
go high light exposure damage eyes many
heard say before, eyes actually two pieces brain, central
nervous system extruded skull. pieces central
nervous system, aka brain, will not regenerate. least right now,
technologies don't exist regenerate neurons humans not want
damage them. bright? Well, painful look at.
blink close eyes order bear it. please don't look bright lights,
painful likely going damage eyes. However, get
morning, still dark want awake, wise turn
artificial lights, particular, overhead lights reasons discussed previously.
overhead lights will optimally trigger neurons, melanopsin cells
retina will activate circadian clock. sun comes out, even
cloud cover, sun come every day regardless live, unless
live cave. People said me, well, live area can't really see
sun. Well, sun there, might hiding behind clouds, unless dark
live like Scandinavia depths winter case might want
artificial light. Get sunlight eyes can. deal
sunlight artificial light not discussed previously. lot photon energy,

11:04 - 100K Lux per morning goal



high amount lux, L-U-X, comes even cloud cover. good number shoot
rule thumb, try get exposure least 100,000 lux 9:00 AM.
10:00 maybe, 9:00 assuming waking sometime
five 8:00 AM. Okay, get 100,000 lux. Now not, want repeat,
not want stare 200,000 lux 100,000 lux light. very, bright.
mechanism circadian clock setting important, mechanism
circadian clock setting involves neurons eye send electrical signals
clock roof mouth system sums, meaning adds photons,

even cloudy day 7,000, 10,000 lux. really remarkable bright is,
meaning much photon energy coming through. try get 100,000 lux
9:00 AM. Now, can't live area world
just not bright enough. people sent pictures Northern England.
just not bright enough winter. sure, can resort using artificial lights
order get enough photons. putting 100,000 lux number target
get day 9:00 AM. can theory, get artificial lights,


special qualities sunlight make sunlight better stimulus. First
all, free available outside. number different... are, excuse
me, number different technologies kind like one like light pad one
says 930 lux. covering 'cause not trying promote specific

sponsor. lets toggle brightness, think holding on, holding
button, can make dimmer brighter. 1,000 lux, seems really
bright, cloudy day outside will five times photon energy coming through.
people set lights ring lights use selfies kind
thing near coffee workstation first thing morning really want get

again, trying achieve kind perfect schedule. recommended, based
scientific literature, look sunlight sometime around

15:15 - Keeping biological clock set

time sun setting reason course adjusts

photon energy early day wake system set circadian clock,
prepare us good night's sleep 14 16 hours later, takes little photon energy
reset shift clock 8:00 PM. want to, much
safely can, avoid bright light even not bright light hours 10
11:00 PM 4:00 AM. number people asked questions this.
last episode went red lights, went ahead discussed blue blockers,
kind stuff, not going repeat that. thing, see
afternoon light, going adjust sensitivity eyes
little bit wiggle room,

16:15 - Reset cortisol

little bit leeway view lights screens overhead lights even late night
without disrupting circadian clock. kind double-edged sword


need lot light early day need avoid bright lights later day.
mentioned studies here, number asked getting

copyright issues deal with. wherever possible, try
reference studies people ask generally put response
comments YouTube Instagram. two studies done
University Colorado, published Current Biology. can easily find
online just googling words, Current Biology, camping reset circadian clocks,
shown two days waking sun avoiding light night,
actually took graduate students camping, cool experiment part of, reset
melatonin cortisol rhythms people otherwise drifted quite far
natural rhythms. There're things can shift clock
reinforce clock. Like exercising less time, eating less
time, etc. not today's episode about. just described perfect
schedule. Get least 100,000 lux light exposure eyes not once,
summing across morning. know much painful
look at, obviously something avoid. middle day,
say, waking 10 11 go outside sun's overhead, forget it, not
going shift clock, just not. doesn't work way. evening, see
evening light want get light adjust retinal sensitivity
afford bit buffer late night, happen look screens go
bathroom middle night, not going shift clock takes
probably 1,000 1500 lux light energy shift clock middle
night. talk shifting clocks jet lagged person, ability
shift clock light, temperature, exercise, food vitally important getting
onto new local schedule. much jet lag today. going
dial one specific parameter can figure without

personal experience, suffer terribly jet lag, traveling certain directions not
others. people don't trouble jet lag. Many people will travel new

jet lag is. Okay well, promised wouldn't get dark terrible things
can happen jet lag, get dark.

21:22 - Jetlag, death lifespan

quality peer reviewed papers showing jet lag will shorten life. will
kill earlier. guess means die earlier. doesn't actually kill necessarily.
Although many cases tourists end stepping front buses,
especially countries cars buses drive opposite side street
used to, jet lagged lose life way. Jet lag serious
thing. Sure family story this. growing up, family

don't experience

23:00 - Going East versus West

mood shifts amnesia, can shorten life. Now interesting.
Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east
takes years off life traveling west. Now, course, traveling 30 minutes
new time zone just one time zone over, two times zone rather, far less
detrimental biology psychology eight hour shift nine hour shift.
Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep
earlier harder. traveling east number different features
associated it, traveling east trying go bed earlier,
know. Californian, go New York city, got get bed three hours
early wake three hours early, much harder coming back California


just staying hours. probably roots evolutionary adaptation
conditions need suddenly gather go forge food,
fight, number different things, can push
release adrenaline epinephrin stay awake. Whereas able slow
deliberately fall asleep actually much harder do. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system plays asymmetry jet lag. So, want
read this, people asked papers, can look,
paper published Davidson colleagues, 2006, Current Biology talks
differences life span frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel
longevity etc. number different biological markers longevity. going east
harder going sleep earlier harder, trying demand.
Many people turned melatonin way try induce sleepiness. going
talk melatonin end. mentioned previous podcasts, number
asked evidence melatonin potentially detrimental
hormone systems, melatonin hormone. discuss end, particular,
role melatonin suppressing hormone pathway involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone men estrogen females. well really interesting
peptide called kisspeptin, cool name. right, well, think travel
happens. say not going eastward westward going north
south. go instance, Washington DC Santiago Chile, go
Tel Aviv, Israel, Cape town, South Africa, just north south, right? not
either direction. not really moving different time zone, not shifting.
will experience travel fatigue. turns jet lag two elements, travel
fatigue time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag simply inability local sunlight
local darkness match internal rhythm, endogenous rhythm have.
get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start

protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will

sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work

hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep

sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across

inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

artificial lights, particular, overhead lights reasons discussed previously.
overhead lights will optimally trigger neurons, melanopsin cells
retina will activate circadian clock. sun comes out, even
cloud cover, sun come every day regardless live, unless
live cave. People said me, well, live area can't really see
sun. Well, sun there, might hiding behind clouds, unless dark
live like Scandinavia depths winter case might want
artificial light. Get sunlight eyes can. deal
sunlight artificial light not discussed previously. lot photon energy,

11:04 - 100K Lux per morning goal



high amount lux, L-U-X, comes even cloud cover. good number shoot
rule thumb, try get exposure least 100,000 lux 9:00 AM.
10:00 maybe, 9:00 assuming waking sometime
five 8:00 AM. Okay, get 100,000 lux. Now not, want repeat,
not want stare 200,000 lux 100,000 lux light. very, bright.
mechanism circadian clock setting important, mechanism
circadian clock setting involves neurons eye send electrical signals
clock roof mouth system sums, meaning adds photons,
slow system. say wake look computer screen
briefly phone screen. probably 500 1,000 lux. look
full minute, get photon energy transferred electrical energy neurons
communicated circadian clock. However, signal
morning will not registered circadian clock unless looked
hundred minutes more, 100,000. Now problem wake eight
o'clock, not going get enough light artificial light reach
called circadian dead zone. opportunity 9:00 AM, maybe
10:00 capture enough photons, eyes.
discussed important previous episodes podcast,
eyes. no extra ocular photo reception. not vitamin D
skin. setting circadian clock paramount mental
physical health. talking trying get least 100,000 photons
not once, got get 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM.
do? go outside. want get nerdy quantitative,
download free app like Light Meter take look around house Light
Meter notice even bright overhead lights emitting 4,000
5,000 lux. going take long looking lights eyes open order
set circadian clock tell brain body morning. Going outside
even cloudy day 7,000, 10,000 lux. really remarkable bright is,
meaning much photon energy coming through. try get 100,000 lux
9:00 AM. Now, can't live area world
just not bright enough. people sent pictures Northern England.
just not bright enough winter. sure, can resort using artificial lights
order get enough photons. putting 100,000 lux number target
get day 9:00 AM. can theory, get artificial lights,


special qualities sunlight make sunlight better stimulus. First
all, free available outside. number different... are, excuse
me, number different technologies kind like one like light pad one
says 930 lux. covering 'cause not trying promote specific
products. actually bought just money Amazon, not
sponsor. lets toggle brightness, think holding on, holding
button, can make dimmer brighter. 1,000 lux, seems really
bright, cloudy day outside will five times photon energy coming through.
people set lights ring lights use selfies kind
thing near coffee workstation first thing morning really want get
sunlight, okay? things kind nice travel going
talk jet lag. can't emphasize enough light captured
summed enter circadian dead zone middle day.
again, trying achieve kind perfect schedule. recommended, based
scientific literature, look sunlight sometime around

15:15 - Keeping biological clock set

time sun setting reason course adjusts
sensitivity eyes diabolical thing. need lot
photon energy early day wake system set circadian clock,
prepare us good night's sleep 14 16 hours later, takes little photon energy
reset shift clock 8:00 PM. want to, much
safely can, avoid bright light even not bright light hours 10
11:00 PM 4:00 AM. number people asked questions this.
last episode went red lights, went ahead discussed blue blockers,
kind stuff, not going repeat that. thing, see
afternoon light, going adjust sensitivity eyes
little bit wiggle room,

16:15 - Reset cortisol

little bit leeway view lights screens overhead lights even late night
without disrupting circadian clock. kind double-edged sword


need lot light early day need avoid bright lights later day.
mentioned studies here, number asked getting
references. process trying get webpage going full links.
copyright issues deal with. wherever possible, try
reference studies people ask generally put response
comments YouTube Instagram. two studies done
University Colorado, published Current Biology. can easily find
online just googling words, Current Biology, camping reset circadian clocks,
shown two days waking sun avoiding light night,
actually took graduate students camping, cool experiment part of, reset
melatonin cortisol rhythms people otherwise drifted quite far
natural rhythms. There're things can shift clock
reinforce clock. Like exercising less time, eating less
time, etc. not today's episode about. just described perfect
schedule. Get least 100,000 lux light exposure eyes not once,
summing across morning. know much painful
look at, obviously something avoid. middle day,
say, waking 10 11 go outside sun's overhead, forget it, not
going shift clock, just not. doesn't work way. evening, see
evening light want get light adjust retinal sensitivity
afford bit buffer late night, happen look screens go
bathroom middle night, not going shift clock takes
probably 1,000 1500 lux light energy shift clock middle
night. talk shifting clocks jet lagged person, ability
shift clock light, temperature, exercise, food vitally important getting
onto new local schedule. much jet lag today. going
dial one specific parameter can figure without
technology devices can apply travel work pleasure, anytime
jet lagged, want absolutely emphasize don't travel get
jet lagged. Many jet lagged. jet lagged looking
phone middle night, jet lagged 'cause waking different
times day, jet lagged exercise kind chaotic regime,
days time, days time. works you, great. want
really clear number people always say, well, know know


needed four hours sleep and, just fine, traveled Europe
just fine. lot individual variability. going talk
origins variability. mean, know people can eat anything
somehow seem maintain great lipid profiles know, body weight fitness
ability. know people eat one cracker sort dissolve
puddle kind tears, right, think going throw off
maybe does, don't know. tremendous amount variability there. So,
really optimal possible. ask, can just say
personal experience, suffer terribly jet lag, traveling certain directions not
others. people don't trouble jet lag. Many people will travel new
location, feel great first day night crash
trouble sleeping. travel back terrible time getting back onto
normal schedule. varies age varies genetics
no simple pill anything can take just get rid jet lag. doesn't
work way. worked way, tell you. simple things
can do. going arm knowledge jet lag
works. contrary many people say believe, know
understanding mechanism affords flexibility. understand mechanism
just opposed just writing PDF giving list things do? Well,
happens can't things exactly way written down.
understand mechanism, understand control machine
biological system, nervous system. little bit understanding
mechanism goes really long way. headed. talk
jet lag is. Okay well, promised wouldn't get dark terrible things
can happen jet lag, get dark.

21:22 - Jetlag, death lifespan

quality peer reviewed papers showing jet lag will shorten life. will
kill earlier. guess means die earlier. doesn't actually kill necessarily.
Although many cases tourists end stepping front buses,
especially countries cars buses drive opposite side street
used to, jet lagged lose life way. Jet lag serious
thing. Sure family story this. growing up, family


member travel overseas work take sleeping pill, won't name sleeping pill,
though end going talk sleeping pills, case total amnesia
week. not entirely uncommon. ever really jet lagged fallen
asleep, doesn't even middle day, woken up, might not know
are. time space really linked brain, wasn't
designed transported four, five six hours new time zone, just wasn't.
brain biological mechanisms govern circadian timing designed
shifted couple hours, not necessarily six nine 12 hours. can really
mess up. experience, usually experience fluctuations
mood. flew 12 hours phase, Abu Dhabi once, give talk NYU Abu Dhabi,
mess. actually getting vertigo. wasn't hallucinating really
it. mood just place. bizarre. Jet lag, even
don't experience

23:00 - Going East versus West

mood shifts amnesia, can shorten life. Now interesting.
Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east
takes years off life traveling west. Now, course, traveling 30 minutes
new time zone just one time zone over, two times zone rather, far less
detrimental biology psychology eight hour shift nine hour shift.
Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep
earlier harder. traveling east number different features
associated it, traveling east trying go bed earlier,
know. Californian, go New York city, got get bed three hours
early wake three hours early, much harder coming back California


just staying hours. probably roots evolutionary adaptation
conditions need suddenly gather go forge food,
fight, number different things, can push
release adrenaline epinephrin stay awake. Whereas able slow
deliberately fall asleep actually much harder do. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system plays asymmetry jet lag. So, want
read this, people asked papers, can look,
paper published Davidson colleagues, 2006, Current Biology talks
differences life span frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel
longevity etc. number different biological markers longevity. going east
harder going sleep earlier harder, trying demand.
Many people turned melatonin way try induce sleepiness. going
talk melatonin end. mentioned previous podcasts, number
asked evidence melatonin potentially detrimental
hormone systems, melatonin hormone. discuss end, particular,
role melatonin suppressing hormone pathway involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone men estrogen females. well really interesting
peptide called kisspeptin, cool name. right, well, think travel
happens. say not going eastward westward going north
south. go instance, Washington DC Santiago Chile, go
Tel Aviv, Israel, Cape town, South Africa, just north south, right? not
either direction. not really moving different time zone, not shifting.
will experience travel fatigue. turns jet lag two elements, travel
fatigue time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag simply inability local sunlight
local darkness match internal rhythm, endogenous rhythm have.
get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved

shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake

evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship

interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums

literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind

maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45

Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight

acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

little bit leeway view lights screens overhead lights even late night
without disrupting circadian clock. kind double-edged sword


need lot light early day need avoid bright lights later day.
mentioned studies here, number asked getting
references. process trying get webpage going full links.
copyright issues deal with. wherever possible, try
reference studies people ask generally put response
comments YouTube Instagram. two studies done
University Colorado, published Current Biology. can easily find
online just googling words, Current Biology, camping reset circadian clocks,
shown two days waking sun avoiding light night,
actually took graduate students camping, cool experiment part of, reset
melatonin cortisol rhythms people otherwise drifted quite far
natural rhythms. There're things can shift clock
reinforce clock. Like exercising less time, eating less
time, etc. not today's episode about. just described perfect
schedule. Get least 100,000 lux light exposure eyes not once,
summing across morning. know much painful
look at, obviously something avoid. middle day,
say, waking 10 11 go outside sun's overhead, forget it, not
going shift clock, just not. doesn't work way. evening, see
evening light want get light adjust retinal sensitivity
afford bit buffer late night, happen look screens go
bathroom middle night, not going shift clock takes
probably 1,000 1500 lux light energy shift clock middle
night. talk shifting clocks jet lagged person, ability
shift clock light, temperature, exercise, food vitally important getting
onto new local schedule. much jet lag today. going
dial one specific parameter can figure without
technology devices can apply travel work pleasure, anytime
jet lagged, want absolutely emphasize don't travel get
jet lagged. Many jet lagged. jet lagged looking
phone middle night, jet lagged 'cause waking different
times day, jet lagged exercise kind chaotic regime,
days time, days time. works you, great. want
really clear number people always say, well, know know


needed four hours sleep and, just fine, traveled Europe
just fine. lot individual variability. going talk
origins variability. mean, know people can eat anything
somehow seem maintain great lipid profiles know, body weight fitness
ability. know people eat one cracker sort dissolve
puddle kind tears, right, think going throw off
maybe does, don't know. tremendous amount variability there. So,
really optimal possible. ask, can just say
personal experience, suffer terribly jet lag, traveling certain directions not
others. people don't trouble jet lag. Many people will travel new
location, feel great first day night crash
trouble sleeping. travel back terrible time getting back onto
normal schedule. varies age varies genetics
no simple pill anything can take just get rid jet lag. doesn't
work way. worked way, tell you. simple things
can do. going arm knowledge jet lag
works. contrary many people say believe, know
understanding mechanism affords flexibility. understand mechanism
just opposed just writing PDF giving list things do? Well,
happens can't things exactly way written down.
understand mechanism, understand control machine
biological system, nervous system. little bit understanding
mechanism goes really long way. headed. talk
jet lag is. Okay well, promised wouldn't get dark terrible things
can happen jet lag, get dark.

21:22 - Jetlag, death lifespan

quality peer reviewed papers showing jet lag will shorten life. will
kill earlier. guess means die earlier. doesn't actually kill necessarily.
Although many cases tourists end stepping front buses,
especially countries cars buses drive opposite side street
used to, jet lagged lose life way. Jet lag serious
thing. Sure family story this. growing up, family


member travel overseas work take sleeping pill, won't name sleeping pill,
though end going talk sleeping pills, case total amnesia
week. not entirely uncommon. ever really jet lagged fallen
asleep, doesn't even middle day, woken up, might not know
are. time space really linked brain, wasn't
designed transported four, five six hours new time zone, just wasn't.
brain biological mechanisms govern circadian timing designed
shifted couple hours, not necessarily six nine 12 hours. can really
mess up. experience, usually experience fluctuations
mood. flew 12 hours phase, Abu Dhabi once, give talk NYU Abu Dhabi,
mess. actually getting vertigo. wasn't hallucinating really
it. mood just place. bizarre. Jet lag, even
don't experience

23:00 - Going East versus West

mood shifts amnesia, can shorten life. Now interesting.
Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east
takes years off life traveling west. Now, course, traveling 30 minutes
new time zone just one time zone over, two times zone rather, far less
detrimental biology psychology eight hour shift nine hour shift.
Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep
earlier harder. traveling east number different features
associated it, traveling east trying go bed earlier,
know. Californian, go New York city, got get bed three hours
early wake three hours early, much harder coming back California


just staying hours. probably roots evolutionary adaptation
conditions need suddenly gather go forge food,
fight, number different things, can push
release adrenaline epinephrin stay awake. Whereas able slow
deliberately fall asleep actually much harder do. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system plays asymmetry jet lag. So, want
read this, people asked papers, can look,
paper published Davidson colleagues, 2006, Current Biology talks
differences life span frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel
longevity etc. number different biological markers longevity. going east
harder going sleep earlier harder, trying demand.
Many people turned melatonin way try induce sleepiness. going
talk melatonin end. mentioned previous podcasts, number
asked evidence melatonin potentially detrimental
hormone systems, melatonin hormone. discuss end, particular,
role melatonin suppressing hormone pathway involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone men estrogen females. well really interesting
peptide called kisspeptin, cool name. right, well, think travel
happens. say not going eastward westward going north
south. go instance, Washington DC Santiago Chile, go
Tel Aviv, Israel, Cape town, South Africa, just north south, right? not
either direction. not really moving different time zone, not shifting.
will experience travel fatigue. turns jet lag two elements, travel
fatigue time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag simply inability local sunlight
local darkness match internal rhythm, endogenous rhythm have.
get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking

1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care

Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east

Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity

get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help

Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep

get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature

going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can

adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

support late shifted rhythm extended sleep phase. data
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences, others
Stanford, showing turning lights room teen wake
helps get sleep subsequent night, also tricks going sleep


little bit earlier. gives 45 minutes deep sleep.
shown statistically, total sleep time increases well. hiding covers,
not going work, eyes don't open. know parents now
coming flashlight flashing kids eyelids
wake hopes getting work, told working. not
part standard study. seem work because, now know why,
light's getting eyelids, say 8:00 kid still
asleep going wake 10, giving light just around
temperature minimum, going make want go sleep earlier.
case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
love know are. know, please don't go taking red pills

personal experience, suffer terribly jet lag, traveling certain directions not
others. people don't trouble jet lag. Many people will travel new
location, feel great first day night crash
trouble sleeping. travel back terrible time getting back onto
normal schedule. varies age varies genetics
no simple pill anything can take just get rid jet lag. doesn't
work way. worked way, tell you. simple things
can do. going arm knowledge jet lag
works. contrary many people say believe, know
understanding mechanism affords flexibility. understand mechanism
just opposed just writing PDF giving list things do? Well,
happens can't things exactly way written down.
understand mechanism, understand control machine
biological system, nervous system. little bit understanding
mechanism goes really long way. headed. talk
jet lag is. Okay well, promised wouldn't get dark terrible things
can happen jet lag, get dark.

21:22 - Jetlag, death lifespan

quality peer reviewed papers showing jet lag will shorten life. will
kill earlier. guess means die earlier. doesn't actually kill necessarily.
Although many cases tourists end stepping front buses,
especially countries cars buses drive opposite side street
used to, jet lagged lose life way. Jet lag serious
thing. Sure family story this. growing up, family


member travel overseas work take sleeping pill, won't name sleeping pill,
though end going talk sleeping pills, case total amnesia
week. not entirely uncommon. ever really jet lagged fallen
asleep, doesn't even middle day, woken up, might not know
are. time space really linked brain, wasn't
designed transported four, five six hours new time zone, just wasn't.
brain biological mechanisms govern circadian timing designed
shifted couple hours, not necessarily six nine 12 hours. can really
mess up. experience, usually experience fluctuations
mood. flew 12 hours phase, Abu Dhabi once, give talk NYU Abu Dhabi,
mess. actually getting vertigo. wasn't hallucinating really
it. mood just place. bizarre. Jet lag, even
don't experience

23:00 - Going East versus West

mood shifts amnesia, can shorten life. Now interesting.
Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east
takes years off life traveling west. Now, course, traveling 30 minutes
new time zone just one time zone over, two times zone rather, far less
detrimental biology psychology eight hour shift nine hour shift.
Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep
earlier harder. traveling east number different features
associated it, traveling east trying go bed earlier,
know. Californian, go New York city, got get bed three hours
early wake three hours early, much harder coming back California


just staying hours. probably roots evolutionary adaptation
conditions need suddenly gather go forge food,
fight, number different things, can push
release adrenaline epinephrin stay awake. Whereas able slow
deliberately fall asleep actually much harder do. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system plays asymmetry jet lag. So, want
read this, people asked papers, can look,
paper published Davidson colleagues, 2006, Current Biology talks
differences life span frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel
longevity etc. number different biological markers longevity. going east
harder going sleep earlier harder, trying demand.
Many people turned melatonin way try induce sleepiness. going
talk melatonin end. mentioned previous podcasts, number
asked evidence melatonin potentially detrimental
hormone systems, melatonin hormone. discuss end, particular,
role melatonin suppressing hormone pathway involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone men estrogen females. well really interesting
peptide called kisspeptin, cool name. right, well, think travel
happens. say not going eastward westward going north
south. go instance, Washington DC Santiago Chile, go
Tel Aviv, Israel, Cape town, South Africa, just north south, right? not
either direction. not really moving different time zone, not shifting.
will experience travel fatigue. turns jet lag two elements, travel
fatigue time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag simply inability local sunlight
local darkness match internal rhythm, endogenous rhythm have.
get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping

this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay

end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can

allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue

time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,

darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally

sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep

maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods

Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize

longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know

different levels quality stringency. can complicated
bottle not always getting. quality getting varies
company company, even substance substance, batch batch.
pleased say partnering Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,
supplement company works Mayo Clinic, pretty much major
sports team organizations know highest levels stringency
terms bottle matches listed bottle, terms
quality put supplements. So, mentioned earlier,
supplements aren't everybody. interested trying
supplements might want check Thorne. want can go
thorne.com/u/huberman. t-h-o-r-n-e.com, c-o-m slash letter u slash huberman,
that, give 20% off supplements happen
purchase Thorne. Thanks much time attention. really appreciate it.
See next time Huberman Lab Podcast. always, thanks

member travel overseas work take sleeping pill, won't name sleeping pill,
though end going talk sleeping pills, case total amnesia
week. not entirely uncommon. ever really jet lagged fallen
asleep, doesn't even middle day, woken up, might not know
are. time space really linked brain, wasn't
designed transported four, five six hours new time zone, just wasn't.
brain biological mechanisms govern circadian timing designed
shifted couple hours, not necessarily six nine 12 hours. can really
mess up. experience, usually experience fluctuations
mood. flew 12 hours phase, Abu Dhabi once, give talk NYU Abu Dhabi,
mess. actually getting vertigo. wasn't hallucinating really
it. mood just place. bizarre. Jet lag, even
don't experience

23:00 - Going East versus West

mood shifts amnesia, can shorten life. Now interesting.
Traveling westward globe always easier traveling eastward, okay?
interesting effects jet lag longevity, shown traveling east
takes years off life traveling west. Now, course, traveling 30 minutes
new time zone just one time zone over, two times zone rather, far less
detrimental biology psychology eight hour shift nine hour shift.
Now, interesting. think effects jet lag longevity
idea can shorten lives, ask why, that?
turns pretty simple explanation this. talked
autonomic nervous system, set neurons spinal cord body brain
regulate wakefulness sleepiness. Turns human beings,
probably species, better able activate stay alert shut
nervous system go sleep demand. really push,
really stay awake, can it, can stay later. falling asleep
earlier harder. traveling east number different features
associated it, traveling east trying go bed earlier,
know. Californian, go New York city, got get bed three hours
early wake three hours early, much harder coming back California


just staying hours. probably roots evolutionary adaptation
conditions need suddenly gather go forge food,
fight, number different things, can push
release adrenaline epinephrin stay awake. Whereas able slow
deliberately fall asleep actually much harder do. asymmetry
autonomic nervous system plays asymmetry jet lag. So, want
read this, people asked papers, can look,
paper published Davidson colleagues, 2006, Current Biology talks
differences life span frequent eastward versus westward, versus no travel
longevity etc. number different biological markers longevity. going east
harder going sleep earlier harder, trying demand.
Many people turned melatonin way try induce sleepiness. going
talk melatonin end. mentioned previous podcasts, number
asked evidence melatonin potentially detrimental
hormone systems, melatonin hormone. discuss end, particular,
role melatonin suppressing hormone pathway involves luteinizing
hormone testosterone men estrogen females. well really interesting
peptide called kisspeptin, cool name. right, well, think travel
happens. say not going eastward westward going north
south. go instance, Washington DC Santiago Chile, go
Tel Aviv, Israel, Cape town, South Africa, just north south, right? not
either direction. not really moving different time zone, not shifting.
will experience travel fatigue. turns jet lag two elements, travel
fatigue time zone jet lag. Time zone jet lag simply inability local sunlight
local darkness match internal rhythm, endogenous rhythm have.
get complicated weeds this, want just
throw couple important things. First all, mentioned earlier, people
suffer jet lag lot, people not much. people experience worse jet lag
get older. reasons early life, patterns melatonin
release stable flat high actually children. one reasons
don't undergo puberty. becomes cyclical puberty, meaning
comes every 24 hours turns off every 24 hours, cycles, cyclic.
get older, cycles get disrupted become vulnerable
even small changes schedule, etc, meal times, right? So, jet lag gets worse


age. addition, things happen age people start less
exercise, digestion can get worse, etc. effects age might not
direct effects getting older things correlated older.
Like people willing regular exercise regime can use exercise
regime shift circadian clock. good friend, father 80s.
still pushing 25, 30 push-ups morning, Peloton whatever
is, lot cycling. 80-year olds that, many not, many 30
year olds not. regular exercise program,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin

females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature

one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

support late shifted rhythm extended sleep phase. data
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences, others
Stanford, showing turning lights room teen wake
helps get sleep subsequent night, also tricks going sleep


little bit earlier. gives 45 minutes deep sleep.
shown statistically, total sleep time increases well. hiding covers,
not going work, eyes don't open. know parents now
coming flashlight flashing kids eyelids
wake hopes getting work, told working. not
part standard study. seem work because, now know why,
light's getting eyelids, say 8:00 kid still
asleep going wake 10, giving light just around
temperature minimum, going make want go sleep earlier.
case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-
effect incidents many cases, people can handle just fine. Again, no
physician, not prescribing anything. professor, profess lot things
opinion. Although, look scientific literature,
impressive data around non-prescription drug type supplements fairly
high safety margins might consider talk doctor always
adding taking anything health regimes, right? health not
responsibility, responsibility, stringent filter. Along lines, one


powerful useful tools mentioned many times plan
mention many many times, website examine.com no affiliation
wonderful site links quality peer reviewed studies relating just
supplement including safety warnings. Will also tell subjects,
whether not rats, cats, elderly folks kids, given study done on,
important, can kind hard pull sites people just
advertising supplements, right? usually don't tell study
rats, kids, etc. three supplements least
tremendously positive effect sleep might
consider. say, everything properly behaviorally still
issues, supplements might good thing you. traveling
want little bit extra help buffering sleep wakefulness protocols.
people like go just supplements. like, take?
people life like, just tell take, know. of,

28:45 - key clock control

going make easier shift circadian clock sake jet lag.
actually knob can turn can leverage shifting clock. go
further, want make changing internal rhythm really easy. least easy
simple one possibly make it, believe. want talk
perhaps one important things know body brain,
called temperature minimum, okay? know approximate weight,
might even know blood pressure, might even know
body mass index, might know things biology
fancy names, everyone know temperature minimum. temperature
minimum doesn't require thermometer measure, although measure it.
temperature minimum point every 24 hour cycle temperature
lowest. Now, measure without thermometer? tends fall 90
minutes two hours average waking time. want repeat that,
temperature minimum tends fall 90 minutes two hours average waking
time. say not traveling typical wake time 5:30 AM.
temperature minimum likely 3:30 4:00 AM. want, want
to, can measure temperature minimum. can get thermometer
can measure temperature every couple hours 24 hours, can find
temperature minimum. going find low point,
temperature minimum, temperature will start rise, wake
two hours later. temperature will continue rise afternoon will peak,
maybe little trough, sometimes happens, it'll start declining slowly
approach nighttime. things will disrupt temperature pattern. Saunas,


cold baths, intense exercise, etc. Meals tend thermogenic effect increases
temperature slightly little blips, overall cycle 24 hour cycle temperature
pattern. last time talked seminal work Joe Takahashi others,
shown temperature

31:01 - Temperature Minimum

actually signal clock roof mouth in-trains
collectively pushes cells tissues body schedule.
Temperature effector. hear immediate, oh,
course, else get different diverse cell types follow
one pattern, right? pancreatic cell something different spleen cell
neuron, right? different things different rates. temperature
signal can go one can interpret temperature signal
one unified consistent theme environment. temperatures vary
person person. people 98.6, people run little colder, etc.
low point, high point. Know temperature minimum.
going figure temperature minimum? temperature minimum can
determined taking last three five wake times. say wake 7:00
AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature
minimum, circadian clock will shift will tend get earlier go


sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower

hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying

beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding

shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,

adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care

AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 AM, right happens. Take those, add together, average
adding dividing number days, that'll give average.
one people wakes 3:00 goes back sleep
sleep till 10, wake time 10:00 AM. use alarm clock, wake-up
time still get up, okay? know alarm clocks kind demonized
world late missing appointments also demonized, use
alarm clock. Many people will wake exactly time day, tends
variation people. people going vary depending life
circumstances. average three seven days so. Take wake time,
can get average sort typical temperature minimum. Okay, now
know get temperature minimum. temperature minimum
absolute reference point shifting circadian clock. Whether not jet lag,
shift work, purpose. deal. expose eyes bright light
four hours, maybe five six, four hours temperature

sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy

definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

support late shifted rhythm extended sleep phase. data
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences, others
Stanford, showing turning lights room teen wake
helps get sleep subsequent night, also tricks going sleep


little bit earlier. gives 45 minutes deep sleep.
shown statistically, total sleep time increases well. hiding covers,
not going work, eyes don't open. know parents now
coming flashlight flashing kids eyelids
wake hopes getting work, told working. not
part standard study. seem work because, now know why,
light's getting eyelids, say 8:00 kid still
asleep going wake 10, giving light just around
temperature minimum, going make want go sleep earlier.
case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
love know are. know, please don't go taking red pills
random try recreate non-experiment experience mine. please

sleep earlier subsequent days, okay? called phase advance, like
read further. advance clock, okay? However, view bright
light four six hours temperature minimum, will tend phase
delay clock. will tend wake later go sleep later. Okay, going
repeat much confusion people talk circadian
time this. Find temperature minimum. tend wake 6:00 AM,
sometimes 6:30, sometimes seven. depends lot night
guessing you. means temperature minimum
probably somewhere right around 4:30 AM. means wake 4:30
view bright light 4:35 AM, going advance clock. going
want go bed earlier subsequent night wake earlier subsequent
morning. shift wake-up time, temperature minimum shifts too, right?
time shift wake-up time temperature minimum shifts,
assuming wake time shifts 30 minutes hour, okay.
view bright light four six hours 4:30 AM, guess what? next night
going want stay later going want wake later subsequent
morning. temperature minimum reference point not temperature reading.
Again, want measure temperature minimum figure is, 98
point whatever 96 point whatever, fine. can that. information
won't help you. need know time body temperature lowest
understand four hours just time, viewing light will advance
clock make want get earlier. four hours
temperature minimum, viewing light will make want stay later. Now,
people might saying, well, wake early want stay late sleepy
day mess feel fine. Look, talk feeling fine. Turns
definition insomnia experiencing excessive sleepiness day.
Sleepiness fatigue different, okay? world sleep medicine fatigue
physical exhaustion, sleepiness falling asleep. Like falling asleep desk
falling asleep lectures, seems something special lectures
makes people want fall asleep. cures insomnia fantastic, however,
seriousness, sleepiness day time unless around temperature
peak lasts 90 minutes so, sign insomnia.

36:30 - Temperature Exercise



sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light

always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will

temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship

interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across

inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

sign lack sleep. want very, clear know temperature
minimum, can shift clock using light. can also shift clock engaging
exercise four hours temperature minimum wake earlier
subsequent nights, exercise delay clock, okay? now can
start see understand logic system. talk works
underlying biology, understanding temperature effector
understanding low point reflects sleepy point,
essentially right waking up, temperature rises, can now start shift
temperature according travel needs. one way might
that. say going travel Europe, nine hours ahead typically,
California. want determine temperature minimum
4:30 maybe 5:00 AM, want start getting 5:30
getting bright light exposure, presumably artificial sources
sunlight isn't going time. Maybe even exercising well, maybe even
eating meal time practice. want start two
three days travel. Because, land land Europe, chances
just viewing sunrise sunset Europe not going allow shift circadian
clock. people say get sunlight eyes land not going
work one two things likely happen. nine hour shift like either
going view sunlight time corresponds circadian dead zone, time
circadian clock can't shifted, going end viewing sunlight
time corresponds four six hour window temperature minimum.
going shift exactly opposite direction want go. can
very, challenging people adjust jet lag. need ask, traveling
east traveling west? trying advance clock delay clock?
Remember viewing light, exercise eating four six hours
temperature minimum will delay clock. Eating, viewing sunlight, exercising,
don't three combination four six hours
temperature minimum will advance clock. powerful mechanism
can shift clock anywhere one three hours per day,
remarkable. means temperature minimum going shift much
three hours, can make can travel way Europe
long prepared day described back home


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay

cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,

right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work

sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine

Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years

longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty

kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake

again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
love know are. know, please don't go taking red pills
random try recreate non-experiment experience mine. please
contact find



1:43:50 - Highlights

acupuncturist know mysterious red pills were,
pretty awesome. again, thrown tremendous amount
information you. hope will figure temperature minimum start
working access sleep wakeful cycles want access. hope
will explore NSDR. might want explore supplementation
thing. now access lot mechanism sleep wakefulness.
keeping theme podcast, stay topic entire month
even slightly more, not done sleep wakefulness. know
different typical podcast format, one week become
superhuman next week to, know, develop growth mindset
kind place episode episode. staying track
really believe drill deeper deeper mechanisms, start
hearing themes again, going start develop
intuition understanding systems work particular life
circumstances. goal really eventually become obsolete.
graduate advisor used call hit bus principle. somewhat morbid
sense humor used be, well, get hit bus tomorrow, going
without blabbing here? don't want get hit bus, plan living
long time, anything say it. get hit bus
tomorrow, sleep wakefulness, right? put
comment YouTube, hope will do. hit bus killed
wouldn't able answer question. know temperature minimum,
understand light early part day valuable. Light want
awake, provided not bright damaging. great whether not comes
screens sunlight sunlight's better. Avoid light four six hours
temperature minimum else going delay clock unless
traveling want do. Okay? Use temperature, increase temperature
shift clock, decrease temperature delay clock, okay? Map
temperature understand it. don't know degree degree across
day, know minimum, know maximum temperature 24 hour cycle
feel great power know also ultradian


cycles, 90 minute cycles within can focused work. Don't expect
focus come early, expect focus come middle kind taper off.
talked little bit kids, little bit elderly, parenting, going
continue, going more. now shift workers, travelers, people jet
lagging home, now levers place. Information can powerful
implement ways, obviously safe ways reasonable ways.
implementing knowledge ways trust safe reasonable
going way can develop bit laboratory yourself. loath
term biohacking, sorry, biohackers. don't believe hacking anything. believe
understanding mechanism applying principles mechanism
large bodies quality peer reviewed data, even whole center mass around
certain biological principles, like effects light temperature, temperature
minimums, will allow shift biology ways want go.
will allow shift psychology ways want go. Next podcast episode,
going talk things. First all, going answer
questions 'cause office hours, didn't get questions
previous episode. read comments paying attention figuring
common questions. going get harder topics.
Someone came me, always fun somebody this, said, well,
just kind basal low-level questions. big stuff?
dreaming lucid dreaming consciousness? Look, talk stuff.
planning that, next episode following episode maybe
even. want give data. want give things supported data.
will try speculate little possible podcast science
science-based tools everyday life. not speculating. Many people
speculated role sleep, dreaming consciousness. Fascinating
topics, rather circular argument frankly, going centuries. Someday
get there, right now concentrating deep biological mechanisms
make allow feel certain ways, good bad, allow
function physically certain ways,

1:48:30 - Feedback Support

good bad, give sense control. goal here. Many people


quite graciously asked can help support podcast. First all, thank
you, appreciate question. can support podcast subscribing
podcast YouTube, well subscribing Apple Spotify. can also leave
us comments feedback YouTube Apple really helps. hope
feedback positive, nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions,
will use questions create future content podcast. well, can
recommend podcast friends family people think might find
information use, terrific. check sponsors mentioned
beginning. really great way help support us ability bring
information. Along lines, lot people asked supplements
supplement companies. now reluctant recommend specific
supplement brands. supplement industry kind wild west different brands,
different levels quality stringency. can complicated
bottle not always getting. quality getting varies
company company, even substance substance, batch batch.
pleased say partnering Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,
supplement company works Mayo Clinic, pretty much major
sports team organizations know highest levels stringency
terms bottle matches listed bottle, terms
quality put supplements. So, mentioned earlier,
supplements aren't everybody. interested trying
supplements might want check Thorne. want can go
thorne.com/u/huberman. t-h-o-r-n-e.com, c-o-m slash letter u slash huberman,
that, give 20% off supplements happen
purchase Thorne. Thanks much time attention. really appreciate it.
See next time Huberman Lab Podcast. always, thanks
interest science. [bright music]


arrive, can potentially accomplish entire shift within anywhere
24 36 hours. really important emphasize arrive
new location talking traveling eastward, California Europe,
arrive new location, keep track temperature
minimum back home shifted trip. Now much
easier think. One unfortunate consequences smartphone
can't something goofy like wearing two watches. One watch
corresponds time back home another one corresponds local time.
Typically updates automatically based wifi, etc. can keep track time
back home can easily shift clock going forward. hoping will makes
sense. really want emphasize don't precise minute.
may asking, well, got temperature minimum
view light one minute going delay clock one minute
going advance clock. doesn't quite work like that, okay.
important understand light primary way can shift clock.
now also able understand things like circadian dead zone
9:30, 10:00 way six hours temperature minimum.
not going shift clock. Nothing time terms light
viewing behavior, feeding, etc, going shift clock. lot people
landing Europe getting sunlight eyes throwing clock whack
not shifting clock all.

41:20 - Eating

brings thing highly recommended. mentioned
before, want eat local meal schedule. practice fast, fast,
fine. eat, want eat within local schedule alertness.
Okay. means arrive everyone's eating breakfast can't stomach
idea breakfast new location 'cause appetite isn't there. means
clock liver, clock liver, biological clock, not caught
new time zone. can force eat like, can skip meal.
don't want stay home meal schedule, waking
middle night eating. really going throw things off lot
clocks periphery like liver, peripheral body, will send information back


brain brain getting really conflicted signals. temperature
minimum really anchor point shifting clock best. don't know
information really hasn't made popular sphere, quite much. sorts
stuff taking things like melatonin, using binaural beats, lot kind like
sophisticated, complicated, potentially problematic ways trying shift clock.
talk melatonin first just want pause shift gears little bit
talked traveling eastward, haven't talked traveling westward.
want now.

42:50 - Go West

say raveling New York California Europe California.
challenge tends be, can stay late enough? Now, people
able mentioned earlier, autonomic nervous system
asymmetrically wired easier stay late later naturally
want go sleep earlier. say land 4:00 PM
just dying, California, came Europe, 4:00 PM really, really
want go sleep. use things like caffeine, exercise, sunlight
can shift you, right? temperature peak viewing sunlight around 6:00
PM 8:00 PM artificial light, isn't sunlight, will help shift later, right?
going delay clock going able stay later. worst thing
can take nap intended last 20 minutes hour.
routinely wake four hours later wake midnight
can't fall back asleep. really want avoid that. provided not excessive
amounts, stimulants like caffeine coffee tea can really help push past
afternoon barrier get sleep like local schedule. eating
local schedule well.

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature
minimum temperature peak, like, use parameters


gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising
phase temperature, can also feel free outside without
wear sunglasses don't worry light exposure. know
window temperature minimum, four six hour window, time
viewing lot light new location, going shift clock
pretty considerably can come back home terrible time.
end graduate school, went Australia, remarkable country, incredible people,
incredible wildlife, amazing time, came back first time life
couldn't sleep regular schedule. sleeping like hour long increments
throughout day, nightmare. took weeks get back target.
way able exercising consistently time every 24
hours, turning home essentially cave night,

57:00 - Emergency resets

even covering windows getting much bright light eyes
possibly day, no sunglasses, etc. can take real work
clock gets thrown whack. phenomenon called ICU psychosis,
people intensive care unit hospitals actually lose mind.
become psychotic, hallucinations, etc. altered circadian cycles.
know 'cause exposed lights sounds, people coming
checking them.

57:30 - Psychosis light

leave hospital cases, experiments people
placed near window get natural light psychotic
symptoms disappear, presuming weren't psychotic symptoms beforehand,
entered hospital. pretty dramatic light can psyche


body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,

inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

44:15 - Pineal myths realities

number people asked use melatonin induce sleepiness.
right, well think melatonin is. Melatonin hormone released
pineal gland, gland. couple notes pineal, 'cause
getting lot questions this. probably going draw fire


happy thoughtful, considerate debate, peer reviewed
papers front us. pineal make hallucinogenic molecule call DMT,
minuscule amounts not responsible hallucinations see
sleep dreaming. Sorry, folks. also not responsible hallucinations
might see approaches DMT. just not, not DMT
comes from. infinitesimally small amounts. lot kind wacky claims
calcification pineal fluoride kind thing. Look, pineal
sits area brain near fourth ventricle, skull not terribly far
away although overlap neural tissue age
aggregation meninges things around stick
skull. Young brains don't look like old brains no calcification pineal,
right? can forget calcification pineal problem. don't know
whole thing got started not issue. pineal will churn
melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping

this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay

cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,

appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm

thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship

interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want

adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal

acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance

melatonin whole life. Melatonin induces sleepiness. Melatonin development
also responsible timing secretion certain hormones vitally important
puberty. melatonin control onset puberty? Not directly, indirectly.
Melatonin inhibits something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
hormone released hypothalamus also roughly roof
mouth brain. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone really interesting 'cause
stimulates release another hormone called luteinizing hormone, females
causes estrogen released within ovaries, involved reproductive cycles,
males stimulates testosterone sertoli cells testes. Melatonin
inhibitory GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, therefore inhibitory LH,
luteinizing hormone, therefore inhibitory testosterone estrogen. just
no two ways it. immense amount data fact high levels
melatonin seasonally breeding animals, takes ovaries nice robust
ovaries capable deploying eggs kind thing literally shrinking
making animals infertile. high levels melatonin
seasonal breeders winter. Melatonin males seasonal breeders takes testes
shrinks them. Long ago UC, Berkeley master's student,
working neuroendocrinology, working hamster species
seasonal breeders. basically days long, inhibits melatonin,
little Siberian hamsters called, testes size of, sort typical
table grapes, although weird way put it. days get shorter


melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall

best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing

things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay

appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can

back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue

time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,

darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place

maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45

Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map

minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not

words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight

acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance

1:48:30 - Feedback Support

good bad, give sense control. goal here. Many people


quite graciously asked can help support podcast. First all, thank
you, appreciate question. can support podcast subscribing
podcast YouTube, well subscribing Apple Spotify. can also leave
us comments feedback YouTube Apple really helps. hope
feedback positive, nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions,
will use questions create future content podcast. well, can
recommend podcast friends family people think might find
information use, terrific. check sponsors mentioned
beginning. really great way help support us ability bring
information. Along lines, lot people asked supplements
supplement companies. now reluctant recommend specific
supplement brands. supplement industry kind wild west different brands,
different levels quality stringency. can complicated
bottle not always getting. quality getting varies
company company, even substance substance, batch batch.
pleased say partnering Thorne, Thorne, spelled T-H-O-R-N-E,
supplement company works Mayo Clinic, pretty much major
sports team organizations know highest levels stringency
terms bottle matches listed bottle, terms
quality put supplements. So, mentioned earlier,
supplements aren't everybody. interested trying
supplements might want check Thorne. want can go
thorne.com/u/huberman. t-h-o-r-n-e.com, c-o-m slash letter u slash huberman,
that, give 20% off supplements happen
purchase Thorne. Thanks much time attention. really appreciate it.
See next time Huberman Lab Podcast. always, thanks

melatonin signal gets longer light inhibits melatonin, days get shorter, melatonin
gets longer. hamsters testes involute size
grain rice. Now not happen humans short days.
nonetheless, melatonin signal really ton effects hormone
system. Now, mean taking melatonin really screwed
hormones? Not necessarily. mean kid taking melatonin
really screwing puberty? Not necessarily why. Melatonin
operates concentration level. child very, small high
levels melatonin, actually can inhibit GnRH, LH, testosterone estrogen depending
sex child. child grows mechanisms, like growth
hormone release, etc, amount melatonin released pineal now
diluted much larger body concentration actually goes way, way down,
okay? problem supplementing melatonin. mentioned
previous episode, concentrations melatonin many commercial supplements
shown anywhere 85% 400% listed bottle.
take melatonin child takes melatonin oftentimes taking super
physiological levels melatonin, least read, literature, says
dramatic effects timing course things like puberty. not
much journals come saying, oh, taking melatonin inhibits puberty,
no single study done super physiological levels melatonin
present lot supplements developing children. melatonin
used widely inducing sleepiness want fall asleep new location
arrived, right? can't fall asleep, take melatonin, helps fall asleep.
not help stay asleep. addition that, melatonin kind touted
best way shift circadian clock. happy go record saying, look,
need melatonin, can work doctor somebody really understands
circadian sleep biology go it, thing. I, always podcast
elsewhere, bias toward behavioral things can titrate control
like exposure light exercise, temperature, etc, much bigger margins
safety certainly don't endocrine effects thinking
talking about. want take melatonin afternoon order fall
asleep evening, guest, you. Again, responsible
health, not me. many people melatonin not going best solution.
best solution going use light temperature, exercise either side


temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start

gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body
rhythms however want. things get whack can tuck right
back place. One thing common people need quick trip. not
always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can
useful planes hotels on. can use light dark can
travel light dark devices can stay home schedule
get light normal wake time back home.
kind nice know circadian dead zone back home,
generally people around 10:00 3:00 PM, basically rising

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

support late shifted rhythm extended sleep phase. data
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences, others
Stanford, showing turning lights room teen wake
helps get sleep subsequent night, also tricks going sleep


little bit earlier. gives 45 minutes deep sleep.
shown statistically, total sleep time increases well. hiding covers,
not going work, eyes don't open. know parents now
coming flashlight flashing kids eyelids
wake hopes getting work, told working. not
part standard study. seem work because, now know why,
light's getting eyelids, say 8:00 kid still
asleep going wake 10, giving light just around
temperature minimum, going make want go sleep earlier.
case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-
effect incidents many cases, people can handle just fine. Again, no
physician, not prescribing anything. professor, profess lot things
opinion. Although, look scientific literature,
impressive data around non-prescription drug type supplements fairly
high safety margins might consider talk doctor always
adding taking anything health regimes, right? health not
responsibility, responsibility, stringent filter. Along lines, one


powerful useful tools mentioned many times plan
mention many many times, website examine.com no affiliation
wonderful site links quality peer reviewed studies relating just
supplement including safety warnings. Will also tell subjects,
whether not rats, cats, elderly folks kids, given study done on,
important, can kind hard pull sites people just
advertising supplements, right? usually don't tell study
rats, kids, etc. three supplements least
tremendously positive effect sleep might
consider. say, everything properly behaviorally still
issues, supplements might good thing you. traveling
want little bit extra help buffering sleep wakefulness protocols.
people like go just supplements. like, take?
people life like, just tell take, know. of,
might want not think might want take
not take. personal preference free country, can like.
Magnesium. magnesium shown increase depth sleep
shown decrease amount time takes access sleep, fall asleep.
comes various forms. talked bunch times magnesium threonate, T-H-
R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate. seems bioavailable form
magnesium. magnesium threonate seems shadowed preferentially brain
want it. certain transporters, actually engages
GABA pathway tends turn off certain areas forebrain allows
kind fall asleep. study, like explore since people serious
supplementation might want explore study, Ates et al, A-T-E-S Dose-
Dependent Absorption Profile Different Magnesium Compounds. Looks like
quality peer reviewed paper. can put link caption, explores
different forms magnesium. seem like magnesium glycinate can similar
magnesium threonate terms tissues shadow to. Magnesium malate, M-A-
L-A-T-E, preferentially shadow muscle, appears, opposed brain.
going muscle repair type thing restoring magnesium stores
periphery opposed brain. Magnesium citrate another name won't
mention ingest, magnesium citrate's main effect, least people
know, seems laxative effect opposed cognitive effect. also


evidence magnesium threonate can neuroprotective. data come
quality labs, mostly rodent studies, not human studies, kind interesting.
again, safety margins things tend pretty high, anytime

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,

temperature minimum shift clock trip land
new location clock starts shift. Okay, now know opinions
melatonin, feel free filter opinions experiences
melatonin. now also understand temperature minimum
represents important landmark either side can use light, temperature,
exercise shift clock. Just remind little bit temperature,

51:13 - Heat-Cold Paradox

want shift clock, typically can take hot shower
will cooling effect hot shower. get
cold shower ice bath access one, afterward going
thermogenic effect body increasing temperature. just think
natural rhythm back home everything's stable, idea low point
temperature minimum, peak, think
hot cold shower rhythm, now able
understand shifting rhythm. temperature rhythm one
going move. Give example. wake morning say
wake 6:00 AM. temperature know rising, passed temperature
minimum. get hot shower, lower body temperature
got out, not normally happening first thing morning,
therefore clock likely get phase delayed, right? going delay
increase temperature. Whereas got cold shower, something don't
personally like do, done time time ice bath going
rebound increase body temperature going phase advance clock.
peak afternoon going come hour earlier. going want
go bed earlier, later night. can start play games timing
hot cold, meals whether not eat, don't eat, light
exposure, whether not view light don't view light. now can start
see understanding core mechanics system can really give
flexibility spend next 25 years life answering every question
every nuance pattern travel. Well, going Sydney going
there, do? you. need figure temperature

gives flexibility. really underscores important thing
understand mechanism not neurotically attached specific
protocol, opposite. gives power not neurotically attached specific
protocol. can give great confidence flexibility able shift body

always going go to, know vacation two weeks or,

53:45 - Staying track

know, work someplace else weeks end. trip 48 hours less, stay
home schedule. can tough may require scheduling meetings
according home schedule, can somehow manage best thing
stay home schedule. clock not going shift
couple hours, even everything correctly one day, okay? travel,
say Europe, actually done this, 24 hour trip Basel, Switzerland, gave
talk came back, people thought crazy but, little bit travel fatigue
'cause remember fatigue actual travel experience. novelty it,
air never great planes, even true mask requirements
things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running
trouble. transit time also important say three days less, stay
home schedule much can. sunlight isn't control
unless something don't know, traveling sort
bright light like light pad showed earlier,
listening just audio, sort looks like eight half 11 inch pad. actually
not designed wake up, actually designed, drawing pad, emits
1,000 lux light. want travel something like that, can use
hotel room wake like. people will use night shades,
know, not night shades eat people say not supposed
eat,

55:30 - Nightshades



don't know anything that, eye covers keep light out. can

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets
cortisol release adrenals really whack. there're cortisol
spikes various hours day, messes learning, really disrupts dopamine
system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

support late shifted rhythm extended sleep phase. data
Dr. Jamie Zeitzer, Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences, others
Stanford, showing turning lights room teen wake

case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-
effect incidents many cases, people can handle just fine. Again, no
physician, not prescribing anything. professor, profess lot things
opinion. Although, look scientific literature,
impressive data around non-prescription drug type supplements fairly
high safety margins might consider talk doctor always
adding taking anything health regimes, right? health not
responsibility, responsibility, stringent filter. Along lines, one


powerful useful tools mentioned many times plan
mention many many times, website examine.com no affiliation
wonderful site links quality peer reviewed studies relating just
supplement including safety warnings. Will also tell subjects,
whether not rats, cats, elderly folks kids, given study done on,
important, can kind hard pull sites people just
advertising supplements, right? usually don't tell study
rats, kids, etc. three supplements least
tremendously positive effect sleep might
consider. say, everything properly behaviorally still
issues, supplements might good thing you. traveling
want little bit extra help buffering sleep wakefulness protocols.
people like go just supplements. like, take?
people life like, just tell take, know. of,

mention ingest, magnesium citrate's main effect, least people
know, seems laxative effect opposed cognitive effect. also


evidence magnesium threonate can neuroprotective. data come
quality labs, mostly rodent studies, not human studies, kind interesting.
again, safety margins things tend pretty high, anytime
going take something new approach caution, especially since
magnesium involved heart rhythm things sort.
supplement beneficial theanine. T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E. Theanine activates certain GABA pathways

get people ingest given type coffee 'cause idea will take
away jitters anxiety, allowing people drink coffee. talking
taking magnesium theanine 30 60 minutes bedtime not day
quell anxiety, rather 30 60 minutes bedtime without food,
hasn't made difference. combination two things really helped.
Theanine sleepwalkers can problem. increase intensity
dreams, gives vivid dreams. sleep walkers people get night
terrors stay away theanine advice. Magnesium theanine might something
explore don't issues. emphasis might.
talked compound, last time talked mechanisms
apigenin derivative chamomile, A-P-I-G-E-N, acts little bit
hypnotic activating chloride channels, hyperpolarized neurons, increases GABA
brain, basically makes feel little sleepy. chamomile, read
Peter Rabbits snuck Mr. McGregor's garden, ate
chamomile, fell asleep, Mr. Gregory came back. Okay, anyone flashing back
elementary school? Okay. story chamomile kind
sedative-like effects, apigenin highly concentrated chamomile also intra-

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
love know are. know, please don't go taking red pills
random try recreate non-experiment experience mine. please

things like that. travel fatigue don't throw clock off.
stay 48 hours, start shift little bit. 72, start running

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets

system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,

night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw

thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods

body. talk little bit different form jet lag requires no planes,
no trains, no automobiles, shift work. Shift work becoming increasingly
common.

58:05 - Shift work

Many us shift working even though don't to. work
middle night, are, know, working computers odd hours, sleeping
day. lot people shelter place type stuff,
this. Kids drifting school schedules. deal shift work.
one rule thumb shift work, possible, want stay
schedule least 14 days, including weekends. Now immediately
cue non shift workers importance not getting far off track
weekend, even not shift worker. sleeping Sunday not good idea.
important thing shift work stay consistent schedule. Now,
conversation Instagram live Samer Hattar, neuroscientist
National Institutes Mental Health, actually head chronobiology unit
there. really emphasizing point shift work people
so-called swing shift, working four days one shift four
days another, extremely detrimental number health parameters. gets

system wellbeing. serious, serious problem. can negotiate
employer stay shift two weeks time, going immensely
beneficial will help offset lot negative effects shift work. Now, don't
presume going able that. just don't
level control. course, want acknowledge shift workers essential,
right? course, first responders, firefighters, police officers, paramedics, etc, also
pilots, night nurses, people working hospital wards, people picking trash.
night shifts critical functioning society, sure can
appreciate. going work shift say, start 4:00 PM
end 2:00 AM, excuse me, important questions arise.
instance, see light shift? Well, matter personal choice
ideally want view much light possible safely possible


need alert. mean 4:00 PM 2:00
want sleep. using light correlate alertness using darkness
correlate sleepiness, means see much light safely can
phase day want awake. thing said way
back beginning podcast episode. see little light safely possible
allows function time want asleep.
finishing 2:00 shift, want avoid bright light
exposure, want go home, really want avoid watching TV possible.
need order fall asleep, case something like dimming
screen, plus blue blockers, practice want
helpful going sleep probably wake late afternoon
early afternoon. might say, wait, Huberman, thought don't like blue
blockers. never said don't like blue blockers. don't like people wearing blue blockers
time day want alert. don't like people asserting blue
blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm
different mine wake around 6:00 AM, 5:00 AM, go sleep


around 11:00 PM, okay? 24 hour-ish circadian cycle, except mine
aligned rise setting sun not, right?
know internal temperature rhythm. no don't walk around
thermometer wherever, taking temperature. Although it'd great
devices there, know, people counting steps, think it'd great
people circadian body temperature measurement. not involved
device development think real call arms, pun intended, wristband
measure temperature tell temperature minimum
travel whatnot. don't know, maybe devices already that.
don't, should. absolutely absurd wouldn't simple
measurement, easy get kind information. don't even need exact
temperature read need know high low point. say
shift worker

1:04:20 - night: watch sunrise?

really nocturnal, flipped. Well, want stay nocturnal schedule.
Now can hard families social life kinds. person
working say from, know, 8:00 PM, like sundown sunrise, raises question.
looking sunrise watching sunset? Waking
sunset, going asleep sunrise. think, well, light going throw
off? Ah, probably not. just actually going invert sunrise sunset are.
waking morning, look the, know, get
sunlight eyes, look sun get bright light devices
overhead lights apartment home, well, going tend wake
evening, right? it's, know don't know stated clearly,
evening sun setting looking setting sun, morning sun
person will wake night shift. temperature rising.
toward morning, happening? Okay, well, closing work shift.
going home, sun rising. look rising sun? Well, based
now know eyes sensitive resetting circadian clocks. will
time? classroom, either cold call somebody wait
oh, oh, oh, oh person audience inevitably exists. temperature
person, while, temperature falling, not rising. will


rising. 'cause diurnal, awake day. person
temperature's falling view light temperature falling. going
do? going phase delay them. going make harder get sleep
following night. say person watch setting sun help
wake 'cause going work night shift, probably
sunglasses avoid viewing bright light go sleep.
thing. just inverted typical person diurnal,
inverted schedule. really trying hard make really clear.
kind two patterns requests world noticing kind ventured
landscape social media podcasts. people want know
every detail

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

blockers can prevent circadian shifts simply people wearing them.
brightness light important not blue. want wear
them, wear them, just dim lights turn lights off. say go sleep
at, get home 4:00 PM 2:00 shift, maybe eat something, go
sleep, wake noon 1:00 PM. get light eyes?
Well, first assumption based said previously might
circadian dead zone can't noon 1:00 PM. not
circadian dead zone somebody goes sleep early morning
2:00 AM. not like circadian dead zone strict time day, internal
biological clock.

1:02:40 - Temperature-Light Rule

need know? guessed it, need know temperature
minimum. need know whether not temperature increasing decreasing.
now can make whole thing even simpler just say, temperature
decreasing, avoid light. temperature increasing, get light. simple, okay?
temperature decreasing, avoid light, temperature increasing, get light.
shift worker works 4:00 PM 2:00 temperature rhythm

1:06:45 - Error correction good

want quantify everything 'cause want get exactly right. like
graduate students students don't want make mistake. quote
graduate advisor, provided mistakes not dangerous, certainly not lethal, kind
want make little mistakes can adjust, right? don't want
endanger yourself. actually, not going get things perfect, called
learning. Learning realize, ah, viewed sun time stayed
really messed up, never again. category people
seem want one size fits kind like give pill give protocol.
things generally work don't afford people flexibility.
anything like that, temperature minimum thing just hammering
today something can
really use key landmark shifting clock. suppose third category,
is, people accept biological systems actually much forgiving
way sometimes described. going use opportunity
editorialize little bit. know, much made sleep debt. Look isn't
IRS equivalent sleep. not going come around try collect
sleep didn't get. No one really knows consequences going
next person sleep didn't get. can't really
recover sleep missed on,



1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,

shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums

literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help

couple tools can helpful. first one going try

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go

sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty

means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,

kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature

temperature minimum, going make want go sleep earlier.
case teens, reason don't quite understand, sleep longer, 45
minutes longer, spend time deep sleep. Adults can too, can
persuade someone put lights timer lights go wake up,
really going help wake earlier, okay. starting hear
themes really resounding again, reassuring you,
right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-
effect incidents many cases, people can handle just fine. Again, no
physician, not prescribing anything. professor, profess lot things

impressive data around non-prescription drug type supplements fairly
high safety margins might consider talk doctor always
adding taking anything health regimes, right? health not
responsibility, responsibility, stringent filter. Along lines, one


powerful useful tools mentioned many times plan
mention many many times, website examine.com no affiliation
wonderful site links quality peer reviewed studies relating just
supplement including safety warnings. Will also tell subjects,
whether not rats, cats, elderly folks kids, given study done on,
important, can kind hard pull sites people just

know, seems laxative effect opposed cognitive effect. also


evidence magnesium threonate can neuroprotective. data come
quality labs, mostly rodent studies, not human studies, kind interesting.
again, safety margins things tend pretty high, anytime
going take something new approach caution, especially since
magnesium involved heart rhythm things sort.

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
love know are. know, please don't go taking red pills

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship

provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good

Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty



evening sunlight eyes can can't get that, use artificial light,
okay? later life? kids now, adolescents, teens, true teens
tendency wake later go sleep later. part, just sleeping
lot more. churning gonadotropin-releasing hormone luteinizing hormone.
whole bodies changing. don't know whether not people realize this,
fastest rate aging us will ever undergo puberty. fastest rate
aging. huge number biological processes happening
puberty, probably devote whole episode puberty fascinating aspect life
course accelerated period aging. circadian clock mechanisms
sometimes intact, sometimes little dismantled going
change, prioritize duration sleep adolescents teens. Now,
means sleeping 2:00 PM, waking night,
night part can become problem especially devices, texting
rooms playing video games. Morning evening sunlight ideal
kids just going sleep morning sunlight. However,
measure temperature, find temperature minimum
come later morning. not going 8:00 AM. going maybe even
10:00 AM, sleeping 11 12. might 8:00 sleeping
10. Remember temperature minimum two hours average waking
time, typically. teens, maximizes total amount sleep. Try get regular
sunlight either morning evening both. sleeping
morning sunrise, probably not much issue, waking
depriving sleep probably worse T-min, temperature
minimum, actually falling later. circadian dead zone later, etc. think
adolescents teens makes sense kind give little bit rope terms
allowing leeway adjust schedule. schools even
starting classes later basis good biology

1:29:50 - Light waking better sleep

right.

1:31:20 - Older people cicadian rhythms

core mechanisms. Fortunately, aren't 1,000 different mechanisms.
Now elderly, real tendency want go sleep early wake
early. people talk physician. evidence
melatonin levels patterns melatonin secretion can become little chaotic
elderly folks. mean elderly? Well, going differ. Rates aging differ,
right? see 65 year olds struggling move seem much older
65 year olds are, know, still hustling around tons energy.
lot variation, genetic, lifestyle factors, know,
really varies. Certainly lifestyle factors can play important role rates aging. think
prominent results sleep circadian rhythms elderly
need get much natural light, even windows. realize elderly
folks can't get outside easily. not safe it, can't move around
easily. Exercise can come various forms people can't get outside get ton
sunlight jogging cycling. not able that, light window
case, open window ideally, temperature reasons, etc, sometimes window
closed. Getting people near window away artificial light early


day, away artificial lights night phase can tremendous effect.
elderly melatonin might viable option.
discussed physician, course, know, way past puberty time
point. cases, people 70s, 80s, 90s, not churning
lot GnRH luteinizing hormone begin with. struggles
falling asleep staying asleep, parameters things described
still apply, light, exercise, temperature, etc, melatonin might
greatest benefit. again, not pushing melatonin think elderly folks
trouble falling staying asleep, might worthwhile. are,
just also mention regular schedule folks elderly
much natural light safely possible,

1:33:48 - Sleepy Supplements

going key levers adjusting sleep circadian schedules.
mentioned previous podcasts, supplements besides melatonin.
supplements quite good sleep. know, not supplement
pusher, somebody takes supplements, believe them, worked
not worked well, certainly believe getting behaviors
right. Whether not NSDR protocols, viewing natural light, exercise, hot baths,
cold showers, you, behavioral protocols first. supplements
mentioned previous podcasts seemed get lot questions about.
just want take couple minutes just talk supplements
can beneficial helping turning off thinking, accessing deeper sleep, even
able compact sleep schedule shorter period hours, meaning
getting well less sleep. People take lot sleeping pills. not going tell
people not take sleeping pills. can problematic, habit-forming, high side-
effect incidents many cases, people can handle just fine. Again, no
physician, not prescribing anything. professor, profess lot things

1:42:00 - Red Pills & Acupuncture

actually request you. really interesting experience
postdoc. went first time acupuncturist. know there're varying thoughts
opinions acupuncture. can't say benefit much
acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-
inflammatory compounds depending acupuncture done. really
good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals
sleep, remarkable. took red pills. Isn't thing now? Take red pill.
don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,

feedback positive, nonetheless, leave us feedback, ask questions,
will use questions create future content podcast. well, can
recommend podcast friends family people think might find
information use, terrific. check sponsors mentioned

1:08:20 - NSDR protocols/implementation

also don't want get neurotically attached schedule
thing called sleep anxiety people trouble falling asleep staying
asleep. want spend moment go back theme said many
times before, tools work called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
hypnosis, gave link, say again, reveriehealth.com
clinically tested, research tested free hypnosis anxiety also sleep.
beneficial people. NSDR protocols, non-sleep deep rest protocols things like
yoga nidra, provided links caption episode two. things
really work. Last night, woke up, went bed 10:30, woke three
morning, knew wasn't feeling rested. NSDR protocol, fell back asleep, woke
6:30, okay. need teach brain nervous system turn off
thoughts go sleep. ideally without medication unless
real need, behavioral protocols. work
involve using body shift mind not trying just turn off thoughts
middle night. Now periods life things stressful people
concerned will struggle getting staying asleep. there's,
really anxiety NSDR protocols also can help with.
always say, middle night wake want go back
sleep middle day, teach nervous system calm
first thing morning didn't feel got enough sleep. words,
whenever opportunity really can help
learn turn parasympathetic/calming arm autonomic nervous
system. no way aware teach system slow
turn off thoughts go back sleep. powerful protocols,
lot research now support fact can really help. Meditation
another example. Certain kinds meditation involve focus alertness.
slightly different meditations involve lack focus attention
say internal states. going pause there, want talk kids
elderly. words, control

1:10:44 - frog skin eye (not joke)



sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less
breeding behavior pathways highly conserved. Now
interesting that, moved modern society much waking
days looking screens, fine, 'cause getting lot light way
although not much sunlight. also night, getting lot light
screens. happened path ways, melanin skin, turnover skin
cells, dopamine, stuff become completely disrupted. Now not say
go back time didn't use artificial lights. think
important thing realize feeling good getting lot light, relationship
dopamine melanin skin, good feelings getting light also skin
provided not getting burned not getting excessive UV exposure,
not just coincidences. hard-wired biological mechanisms exist
everybody regardless light dark skin begin with. another
point, important, dopamine system feel-good
molecule closely related testosterone estrogen reproductive cycles.
Remember melatonin inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,
production hormones, melatonin effector. hormone
darkness. So, just threw lot biology you. not saying like Siberian
hamster, least not ways aware of.

1:16:39 - stress turns hair white

not saying pelage color going change. Actually reason people go
gray really stressed, know this, really
stressed, increase nerve fibers release adrenaline hair follicle
activates peroxide groups hair follicle cause hair actually go
gray white. actually stress make hair gray white. Aging too.
brief aside, interested relationship
light skin tone kind stuff, thought might find
interesting cells eye lot like skin cells frogs animals
shift entire color sometimes metamorphosize.



1:17:24 - Ovaries testes?

know, species literally change shape reproductive
organs. fact, wasn't weird enough, graduate school Berkeley,
another graduate student studying species hermaphroditic mole, right,
little things dig, hermaphrodite mole change ovaries
testes back depending day life. Super cool, super different, wild
biological mechanism. wondering animals reproduce actually
adjust numbers males females depending density males
females. many males, males turn testes ovaries.
there're many females, turn ovaries testes. actually
true hermaphroditic animals opposed pseudo hermaphrodite animals. Okay,
get back track. talk animal care
human animal.

1:18:25 - Babies bright light

New parents babies. right, mentioned earlier, melatonin not cyclic, not
cycling babies, phasic. released kind constant level.
babies tend smaller adults, are. concentrations
melatonin high. baby grows, concentrations per unit volume
going go down. Babies not born typical sleep wake cycle. now
parents saying, tell something didn't know. also have, really want
emphasize this, also much sensitive optics eye. number
people asked me, know, exposing baby sunlight? don't
want avoid sunlight, eyes sensitive, optics eyes aren't
quite developed much know look newborn baby
look little glassy-eyed kind looking even young child.
lot people think seeing way seeing them. Hate break
you, ever can just google visual image like one month old.
optics eyes poor cloudy image. not seeing fine
detail. optics get better, will see clarity.
lot clearing lens aqueous features newborn
eye, don't see well. also don't great ways adjusting


bright light. babies natural aversion bright lights. really want
avoid trying use sunlight really bright light way
adult young baby child. children get older however, melatonin start
become slightly cyclic, slightly cycled, body temperature rhythms
also start fall regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm,
ultradian rhythms. episode, think one two podcast, maybe both,
talked 90 minute so-called ultradian rhythms, every 90 minutes
babies going cycle body temperature hormonal
features. mean, much changing system. child isn't
sleeping? can use phases darkness phases light going
shortened order try encourage sleep want child sleep.
not just not going fall adult-like regime temperature minimum
temperature maximum. temperature minimums maximums
fluctuating much quickly. varies tremendously. Actually interesting
literature whether not siblings, whether not twins, whether
not nursery environment, whether not alone, hopefully baby's
not alone, know mean, sleeping alone room
room. couple things seem help getting
overall environment 24 hour schedule. room slightly colder,
obviously want babies nice cozy, slightly colder like
asleep, slightly warmer times

1:21:40 - Polyphasic sleep

like awake. Babies tend run pretty hot anyway. obviously
want careful avoiding extremes temperature, cold hot.
going 90 minute cycles, going adjust 90
minute cycles well. people say, well, not going help
deal fact need every 90 minutes night?
couple tools can helpful. first one going try
understand relationship calm deep sleep. autonomic nervous
system can put us states panic, kind seesaw autonomic
alertness, goes way panic. can alertness, can alert calm,
right? range there, continuum. can also deep sleep,


end seesaw way light sleep kind
sleepy, just feeling kind relaxed. Perhaps important thing
map baby schedule order make sure getting changings,
nursing, etc, appropriate times, try maintain, can't sleep
can't sleep continuously, try maintain autonomic nervous system place
not going heightened states alertness ideally
sleeping. Now, realize translated try stay calm
sleep deprived, hard people do. non-sleep deep
rest protocols surface can potentially beneficial people able
recover, not necessarily sleep, maintain certain amount autonomic
regulation. look like? look like, baby goes down,
maybe going go 45 minutes. can capture sleep, capture sleep.
data showing called polyphasic sleep. can sleep 45
minute increments batches, even spread throughout day periods
wakefulness between, miserable sound, actually adults
deliberately employed that, don't children sake work
productivity. tend reduce total overall amount sleep need.
hard schedule people maintain baby, baby may
throwing kind schedule anyway. can get 45 minutes sleep
sleep, great. can get another 45 minutes waking go
back sleep, great. many phases sleep can get. can't
sleep data non-sleep deep rest type protocols show least
neurochemical level, want clear means, reset things like dopamine
levels basal ganglia measured things like positron emission tomography, etc.
things tend reset pretty well can access deep rest
state. means not alert throughout entire time baby sleeping.
Trying sort mirror baby's sleep cycle can brutal certain people,
especially trying prepare meals things. recognize
lot constraints parenting not just mapping baby's sleep
schedule. children approach ages one, two, three, four, certainly
optics eyes improved don't want damage eyes course,
bright light. much sensitive even kind 10, 11 years
old. talk vision children moment. trying get longer
longer batches sleep through, hopefully not use administering


melatonin kids 'cause talked potentially
detrimental

1:25:25 - Ultradian cycles children

talk doctor. trying get longer blocks sleep map
onto ultradian cycles. better off get three hour, like two-90
minute cycles, four hour batch sleep waking middle
ultradian cycles can just brutal parent kid. one can't get full six 10,
kids even sleeping 12 hours growing quickly, trying get
batches sleep even fractured throughout 24 hour cycle matched
90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle 90 minutes,
two back back, three back back back. going better waking
middle ultradian cycle. just going set number things
better direction try say, just enforce force full eight 10 hours
sleep. least literature shows. kids sleep great
night, starting young age, others don't. typically hear people
struggling tremendously, losing mind understandably, not
sleeping, kid's not sleeping and, kid sleeping brief periods.
words, try access deep calm can't sleep, try access sleep,
can sleep even fractured. say, well, sunlight
viewing exercise stuff? sleep really, really dismantled, meaning
happening various times day night, especially, times going
especially important parent get morning evening sunlight
circadian clock going tailspin basically wants anchor something.
want give two anchors, morning evening light. Okay, rather
different described shift work, things really chaotic
just not able sleep. Similar circumstances can arise taking care
sick loved one, night. Try stay calm using NSDR protocols, know
harder say, protocols there, free, research
support them. Try get sleep whenever can also try get morning sunlight

1:27:38 - Teens puberty

sleep circadian rhythms wakefulness babies, adolescents, teens, aged
folks. right, talk sleep kids, want tell little story. not joke,
many will relieved not going try tell another joke episode.
relationship light, skin pelage color, dopamine
reproduction, mating. many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters
mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, animals, change color coat.
winter tend lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes flecks
black brown. summer pelage changes color know, brown
red, vastly different color. shift controlled light melatonin.
interesting correlate humans. humans obviously different skin
tones just genetically amount melanin one skin, depending
genetic background. course sunlight will increase amount melanin
skin regardless, right? suntan, sunburn, etc, bronzing, whatever. whole
system wired shifts skin color shifts cells within eye
melatonin actually closely linked. story. Many years ago, meaning
10 years ago, 15 years ago, see 20 years ago, forgive me. guy
named Iggy Provencio running lab uniformed armed services,
standard biological laboratory, discovered opsin eye
cells eye connect rest brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin,
many now know opsin, like pigment, absorbs light. opsin
converts light electrical signals set circadian clock. Iggy discovered
melanopsin similar form frog melanophores.
actually skin frogs allowed frogs go pale white,
dark, 24 hour cycle, pigmented green brown frog.
relationship cells eye pigment cells skin.
also know long days, breeding. work? Well
actually dopamine triggering increases testosterone, mainly males,
estrogen mainly females although course, testosterone estrogen
sexes. kind pathway light, increases melanin,
dopamine reproduction one hand lack light, melatonin, decreases
darkness skin, less melanin skin, case animal fur, white
fur no reproduction hand. humans don't actually shift breeding
patterns tremendously long days short days, although data
shifts. also don't radically change skin color depending


much sunlight exposure have. simple way put is, days long,
lot dopamine feel really good lot breeding
breeding-like behavior. days short, lot less dopamine lot less

acupuncture. now quality peer reviewed studies showing publishing neuron,
Cell Press journal, excellent journal, showing acupuncture can stimulate anti-

good studies, came last year. talked Instagram, may talk
again. well certain acupuncture sites increase inflammation. So, know,
can get different types effects, can't just say acupuncture great across
board. assuming acupuncturist know sites good increasing
inflammation, ones good decreasing inflammation. However,
acupuncturist went gave red pills. said, minerals

don't know means, right, 'cause not tuned in. red pills looked
like little M&Ms, took couple suggestion fell deeply asleep
four hours later woke feeling incredibly rested, rested ever felt
entire life never required four hours sleep. Unfortunately, acupuncturist
moved away, never figured red pills. didn't get chance
mass spectroscopy, still wonder, said minerals. somebody
knows red pills compound is. incredible,
