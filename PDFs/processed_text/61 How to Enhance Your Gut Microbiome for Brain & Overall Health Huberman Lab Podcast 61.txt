excited eating just ate, gut excited eating
just ate, seems kind unified perception brain body. Today,
going talk comes negative sense. Like, know,
meet someone really dislike stomach ache,
positive sense, interact somebody really, really like like
spend time them, instance, eat something really,
really like like spend time food, speak. Now, gut
brain represent call biological circuit, meaning include different
stations. station communicates station B, communicates station C,
on. mentioned earlier, bidirectional. two-way street
gut brain. want make important point outset say word
gut, refer gut, not just referring stomach. us think
gut equates stomach think gut not gut
gut feeling sort. context gut-brain signaling related
microbiome, gut includes entire digestive tract. right, start finish
entire digestive tract much today going talk about, instance,


presence neurons, nerve cells, reside gut communicate specific
locations brain cause release specific neurochemicals,
neurochemical dopamine serotonin, can motivate seek particular
food type interaction behavior, avoid particular foods, interactions,
behaviors. neurons, many neurons, fact, reside
intestines, not stomach. can small intestine large intestine.
fact, actually taste receptors neurons located along digestive
tract. neurons located along digestive tract
communicating brain

00:09:44 Gut-Brain Anatomy

impact think, feel, do. Okay, gut-brain axis,
need deal brain part need deal gut part. just
quickly talk brain part word brain also bit misnomer
say gut-brain axis, include brain includes lot
things well. many probably know now, listeners
podcast, don't, fine, nervous system includes brain
spinal cord together constitute called central nervous system.
neural retinas, lining back eyes light sensing portion
eyes also part central nervous system. actually eyes part
brain. parts brain outside cranial vault.
retinas, brain proper, spinal cord make central nervous system.
parts nervous system constitute called peripheral nervous
system, components nervous system reside outside
retinas, brain, spinal cord. Now, important today going
talk lot gut communicates brain. way
peripheral nervous system components, meaning nerve cells reside gut
elsewhere body communicate brain cross central nervous
system influence think feel, okay? nervous
system part call gut-brain axis, brain, again, just shorthand
including elements just described. Gut, now know, includes
elements digestive tract. talk architecture structure gut
digestive system. Now, not surprisingly digestive system, aka gut,


begins mouth ends anus. along length, series
sphincters cut off certain chambers digestive tract chambers.
Now, also along tube call digestive tract, great variation
degree acidity, pH sometimes called. variation acidity turns
give rise different little microenvironments particular microbiota,
microbacteria, can thrive fail thrive. way like think
digestive tract, gut component gut-brain axis, not just one
component. not just stomach particular acidity bunch
microorganisms work particularly well make feel good make
digestive pathways work well. series chambers, little microenvironments,
particular microbiota thrive microbiota not. certain behaviors
undertake certain experiences will adjust
microenvironments ways make particular microbiota, certain bacteria, likely
thrive others less likely thrive. talk set early
life. Actually moment came world, microbiome
established. actually strongly impacted depending whether not
born C-section vaginal birth. strongly impacted handled
came world, literally hands you. much skin
contact had, whether not preemie baby not, whether not
pets home, whether not allowed play dirt, whether not
allowed eat snails whether not kept antiseptic
environment. experiences shaped little microenvironments shaped
constitutes best worst microenvironments, okay? long
tube call digestive tract very, long. fact, splay
out, take curves turns intestine, find
long. approximately nine meters long. Now, structure digestive tract
turns important terms gut-brain signaling. again, tube
hollow tube called lumen, L-U-M-E-N. walls tube not
necessarily smooth, least not significant portions digestive tract. much
digestive tract, bumps grooves look much like folds
brain, bumps grooves made tissues. made
called mucosal lining, lot mucus there. look
really closely, find little hairy-like cellular processes
call microvilli able push things along digestive tract. microbiota reside


everywhere along lumen digestive tract, starting mouth way
end. reside within microvilli reside within lumen.
look really closely bumps grooves along digestive tract,
find little niches, little areas particular things can
grow reside best. Now, might sound kind gross, actually good thing,
especially growing residing microbacterial organisms good
gut signal good things brain. will talk
signaling looks like done accomplished just moments.
want get clear mental picture gut, something don't often see.
often think gut, again, just think hollow
stomach,

00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome

food going there, getting digested, far complex actually far
interesting that. Now, referring gut microbiome
microbiota bacteria. Let define terms little bit specifically just
avoid confusion. microbiota actual bacteria. microbiome used
refer bacteria also genes bacteria make, turns
make important genes actually impact us. loads
loads little microbiota, bacteria. fact, right now carrying
two three kilograms, six pounds, microbiota,
bacteria. look microscope, see
relatively simple little organisms. remain stationary might plop
mucosal lining might hang particular microvilli
might one little niches, others can move about, basically fill
entire lumen. surround kind coat surface microvilli
tucked little niches available tuck into.
take head pin look microscope, fit many, many
hundreds, not thousands little microbacteria. reason say
many, many thousands more, giving kind broad range there,
vary size and, again, vary whether not can move don't move.
Now, constantly turning gut, meaning born speak
dying off. will stay long periods time within


gut others will get excreted. 60% stool, unpleasant might
think about, made live dead microbacteria. constantly making
excreting microbacteria. microbacteria make many
stay inside gut many leave, meaning many excreted, depends
lot chemistry gut depends strongly foods eat
foods not eat. Now, just eat strongly influences
microbiome, meaning microbacteria, not mean not
influences constitutes microbiome. microbiome also made
microbacteria access digestive tract mouth, breathing,
kissing, skin contact. fact, one major determinants
microbiome interact environment happen in.
actually includes whether not interact animals. little bit, talk
data whether not grew home animals, whether not
grew home, whether not lot social contact, meaning skin
contact, whether not grew animal sparse, contact sparse
environment shapes microbiome. simple point
eat influences microbiome, also do, think, feel,
many low microbacteria get digestive tract way
social interactions. fact, ask neurobiologist role microbiome is,
tell almost certainly impact brain function.
friends microbiologists, do, tell you, well, maybe brain
nervous system support microbiome. way around.
little microorganisms taking residence body. don't
really know far know. don't know
consciousness don't. can't rule out, seems pretty unlikely.
Nonetheless, taking advantage different environments along
digestive tract. taking advantage sorts social interactions, instance,
people talk breathe you, people shake hands with,
people kiss don't kiss, people happen romantically
involved not, dog, cat, lizard, rat,

00:20:01 Roles Gut Microbiome

whatever pet happen impacting microbiome. absolutely no


question that. hopefully now sense architecture
digestive pathway sense trillions little microbacteria
living along different components digestive pathway. haven't
talked yet, like talk now, little microbiota
actually digestive tract. addition just living intents
purposes, contributing, instance, digestion. Many genes
microbiota make genes involved fermentation genes
involved digestion particular types nutrients. little bit, will talk
eat can actually change enzymes microbiome
components make, enzymes largely things responsible digestion.
catalyze sorts cellular events context digestive pathway,
talking enzymes help digest food. microbiota indeed
helping many ways. lack certain microbiota can help digest,
stands reason challenges digesting certain types foods.
amazing thing microbiota change way brain
functions way metabolizing facilitating metabolism particular
neurotransmitters. one ways certain microbiota present gut
can improve mood degrade mood, instance, way certain
microbiota converted facilitating conversion chemicals,
GABA. GABA call inhibitory neurotransmitter. involved suppressing
action neurons. might sound like bad thing, types
sedatives, instance, alcohol, lot neurons naturally make GABA can help
quiet certain circuits brain, instance, circuits responsible anxiety. people
epilepsy, GABAergic neurons, called, can often disrupted
signaling, meaning not cranking much GABA therefore
excitatory neurons, typically release molecules like glutamate can engage
called runaway excitation can give rise seizures. simple
message microbiota way making neurochemicals can influence
way brain functions. want support microbiota will give
tools support microbiota. takeaway point
microbiota making things locally help digest food. microbiota helping
make certain neurotransmitters like GABA, also talk dopamine
serotonin. specific microbiota reside gut profound
influence many, many biological functions,



00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting Stomach

especially immune system function, brain function, digestion. give
fairly complete picture gut microbiome. Now like talk
microbiome brain communicate, accurately, microbiome
rest nervous system communicate. Neurons, simply means nerve
cells, cells heavy lifting nervous system.
course cell types important. Glial cell, instance, very, important
cell types. endothelial cells, responsible blood flow, pericytes
types cells, neurons really heavy lifting
things think terms nervous system function.
neurons gut not surprise you. Neurons reside brain,
spinal cord, eyes, fact, body, got heart
heart, got lungs, got spleen,
connect different organs tissues body. not
surprising neurons gut. surprising, however,
presence particular types neurons reside near mucosal lining just next
lumen gut paying attention, explain mean
paying attention, components gut, nutrients microbiota,
thereby can send signals brain way long wire call axon,
can communicate chemistry nutritional quality
aspects environment gut given location brain
ways can influence brain to, instance, seek particular food. Let
give sort action-based picture this. say like people, enjoy
sweet foods. don't particularly enjoy sweet foods like.
sucker really good dark chocolate really good ice cream got thing
donuts seems just not quit although don't tend indulge often, like
them. eat particular food, obviously digestion starts mouth.
enzymes there, gets chewed up, food goes gut. neurons
activated, meaning causes neurons electrically active particular
components, certain nutrients foods present. cell types,
say neuron types matter here, nutrients really trigger
activation sugar, fatty acids, amino acids. Now, particular neurons


name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod
cells. Neuropod cells discovered Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University.
phenomenal set discoveries made mostly last 10 years. neuropod
cells, mentioned, activated sugar, fatty acids, amino acids,
particularly strong activation sugars. seem part sweet sensing

concentrating neurons gut signal brain.
Bohorquez lab shown neuropod cells part network.
sensing several different nutrients, particular, sense sugar, send
signals form electrical firing brain ways trigger activation
brain stations cause seek particular food. Now,
brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway
experience desire particular foods everything
foods taste. also do, probably know, texture sensation
foods mouth, even indeed go throat sometimes
can pleasing unpleasant. also subconscious
processing taste occurs gut itself. again, say gut, don't just
mean stomach. actually neurons, neuropod cells,
digestive tract signaling brain presence sweet foods,
well foods amino acid rich foods foods rich particular types
fatty acids signaling brain causing seek foods


consume foods. Now, probably asking, signal?
actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go

many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated

interesting that. Now, referring gut microbiome
microbiota bacteria. Let define terms little bit specifically just
avoid confusion. microbiota actual bacteria. microbiome used
refer bacteria also genes bacteria make, turns

gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people

performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure

pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might

even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit

whether not fasting not, tools useful. Now,
consider landmark study exploring relationship gut microbiome,

major gastric distress. turns not already accustomed eating
lot fiber, increasing amount fiber dramatically can cause gastric distress
ease time, see, mechanism behind this,
unveiled study, ease time, system can tolerate
it. Likewise high fermented foods can readily tolerated ramp phase
ingesting maybe one serving day, maybe two servings, ramping
case high six servings per day. However, ramp period, group
assigned high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake six weeks
high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake six weeks
went off either high fiber high fermented food diet
four-week follow period gradually returned baseline. Throughout
study gut microbiome evaluated diversity gut microbiota.
also number measures immune system function, particular
measures so-called inflammatome. immune system lot different

Regardless, study, explored sorts immune markers
expressed either two groups compared those. basic takeaway
paper contrary predicted, high fiber diet not lead
increased microbiota diversity, least not cases. somewhat
surprising. know, idea prebiotic fiber lot material fruits

Basically ingesting high fermented foods fair abundance, right? know, four


six servings per day lot fermented food intake. talk
foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased
inflammation brain body reduced significantly. Now, talk little bit
notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting
gastric distress spreading throughout day. also want mention brine.
Brine liquid surrounds sauerkraut. salty fluid. contains
lot active live cultures. include allowed people include brine
study. discussions Dr. Sonnenburg, go detail
episode comes next week, talk lot particular value brine
might hold terms bringing microbiota diversity richness live
cultures contains. want focus moment high fiber condition
interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows

01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least


knowledge. studies shown, several, one published
journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie
sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, things sort. least
exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
go really deep gut microbiome, less gut-brain axis,

00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome

food going there, getting digested, far complex actually far
interesting that. Now, referring gut microbiome
microbiota bacteria. Let define terms little bit specifically just
avoid confusion. microbiota actual bacteria. microbiome used
refer bacteria also genes bacteria make, turns
make important genes actually impact us. loads
loads little microbiota, bacteria. fact, right now carrying
two three kilograms, six pounds, microbiota,
bacteria. look microscope, see
relatively simple little organisms. remain stationary might plop
mucosal lining might hang particular microvilli
might one little niches, others can move about, basically fill
entire lumen. surround kind coat surface microvilli
tucked little niches available tuck into.
take head pin look microscope, fit many, many
hundreds, not thousands little microbacteria. reason say
many, many thousands more, giving kind broad range there,
vary size and, again, vary whether not can move don't move.
Now, constantly turning gut, meaning born speak

gut others will get excreted. 60% stool, unpleasant might
think about, made live dead microbacteria. constantly making
excreting microbacteria. microbacteria make many
stay inside gut many leave, meaning many excreted, depends
lot chemistry gut depends strongly foods eat
foods not eat. Now, just eat strongly influences
microbiome, meaning microbacteria, not mean not
influences constitutes microbiome. microbiome also made
microbacteria access digestive tract mouth, breathing,
kissing, skin contact. fact, one major determinants
microbiome interact environment happen in.
actually includes whether not interact animals. little bit, talk
data whether not grew home animals, whether not

eat influences microbiome, also do, think, feel,
many low microbacteria get digestive tract way

sedatives, instance, alcohol, lot neurons naturally make GABA can help
quiet certain circuits brain, instance, circuits responsible anxiety. people
epilepsy, GABAergic neurons, called, can often disrupted

message microbiota way making neurochemicals can influence

00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting Stomach

especially immune system function, brain function, digestion. give
fairly complete picture gut microbiome. Now like talk
microbiome brain communicate, accurately, microbiome
rest nervous system communicate. Neurons, simply means nerve
cells, cells heavy lifting nervous system.
course cell types important. Glial cell, instance, very, important
cell types. endothelial cells, responsible blood flow, pericytes
types cells, neurons really heavy lifting
things think terms nervous system function.
neurons gut not surprise you. Neurons reside brain,
spinal cord, eyes, fact, body, got heart
heart, got lungs, got spleen,
connect different organs tissues body. not
surprising neurons gut. surprising, however,
presence particular types neurons reside near mucosal lining just next
lumen gut paying attention, explain mean
paying attention, components gut, nutrients microbiota,
thereby can send signals brain way long wire call axon,
can communicate chemistry nutritional quality
aspects environment gut given location brain
ways can influence brain to, instance, seek particular food. Let
give sort action-based picture this. say like people, enjoy
sweet foods. don't particularly enjoy sweet foods like.
sucker really good dark chocolate really good ice cream got thing
donuts seems just not quit although don't tend indulge often, like
them. eat particular food, obviously digestion starts mouth.
enzymes there, gets chewed up, food goes gut. neurons
activated, meaning causes neurons electrically active particular
components, certain nutrients foods present. cell types,
say neuron types matter here, nutrients really trigger
activation sugar, fatty acids, amino acids. Now, particular neurons


name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod
cells. Neuropod cells discovered Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University.
phenomenal set discoveries made mostly last 10 years. neuropod
cells, mentioned, activated sugar, fatty acids, amino acids,
particularly strong activation sugars. seem part sweet sensing

concentrating neurons gut signal brain.
Bohorquez lab shown neuropod cells part network.
sensing several different nutrients, particular, sense sugar, send
signals form electrical firing brain ways trigger activation
brain stations cause seek particular food. Now,
brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway
experience desire particular foods everything
foods taste. also do, probably know, texture sensation
foods mouth, even indeed go throat sometimes
can pleasing unpleasant. also subconscious
processing taste occurs gut itself. again, say gut, don't just
mean stomach. actually neurons, neuropod cells,
digestive tract signaling brain presence sweet foods,
well foods amino acid rich foods foods rich particular types
fatty acids signaling brain causing seek foods


consume foods. Now, probably asking, signal?
actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go
names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, forth. Sometimes
people refer neurotransmitters. Technically neuromodulators.
refer almost always neuromodulators. neuropod cells signal way
particular branch vagus nodose ganglion talked
number different stations brain stem, eventually cause
release neuromodulator dopamine. Dopamine often associated sense
pleasure reward appropriately thought neuromodulator
impacts motivation, craving, pursuit. tends put us modes action, not
necessarily running moving space, although can too,
context feeding, tends make us look around more, chew more, reach things
more, seek whatever giving us sensation delight

interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,
undergraduate lab, think, well, won't him, now gone
medical school think passed residency practicing doctor,
nonetheless, always making kombucha home. told exceedingly
easy, again, number skills attributes made think


pretty much anything ease, whereas tend struggle even
basic cooking. maybe feeling little adventurous, explore
making kombucha. number different protocols recipes
making low-sugar fermented foods. needn't run
buy fresh sauerkraut time. also mention
interested getting fermented intake pickles, jarred pickles rarely ever
contain ferment. Mostly just soaked vinegar, water, spices,
contain ferment. actually look container.
don't know, maybe someone knows make natto knows

microbiome diversity indeed gut-brain function. last suggest
people completely forego fiber. think debate much
fiber need whether not certain forms fiber better others. not
going get debate. barbed wire enough without injecting views
debate. think ample evidence support fact
people ingesting fair amount fiber going good idea. just say
make sure also ingesting fair amount fermented foods. along
lines fiber, accompanying article published "Cell", sort

01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least


knowledge. studies shown, several, one published
journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie
sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, things sort. least
exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, category neurons can
respond artificial sweeteners signal information brain, pattern
signaling indeed signature pattern conveyed brain received
brain actually quite bit different neurons responding
artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. interesting
means first neurons incredible specificity terms

meaning doesn't calories despite sweet. Now, again,
subconscious processing. like previous studies just discussing


artificial sweeteners generally gut microbiome generally, unclear
relates humans point time. given similarity cellular processes

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
go really deep gut microbiome, less gut-brain axis,
really deep gut microbiome, is, does, doesn't do,
emerging findings lab yet published. also excited
episode think many us heard gut microbiome.
hear bacteria live gut. hear gut-brain axis
90% serotonin make made gut. hear gut


second brain forth. think many people, don't really clear
picture gut microbiome pathways mechanisms can
signal brain parts body. hope today's information
least improved clarity around topic

especially growing residing microbacterial organisms good
gut signal good things brain. will talk
signaling looks like done accomplished just moments.
want get clear mental picture gut, something don't often see.
often think gut, again, just think hollow
stomach,

00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome

food going there, getting digested, far complex actually far
interesting that. Now, referring gut microbiome
microbiota bacteria. Let define terms little bit specifically just
avoid confusion. microbiota actual bacteria. microbiome used
refer bacteria also genes bacteria make, turns
make important genes actually impact us. loads
loads little microbiota, bacteria. fact, right now carrying
two three kilograms, six pounds, microbiota,
bacteria. look microscope, see
relatively simple little organisms. remain stationary might plop
mucosal lining might hang particular microvilli
might one little niches, others can move about, basically fill
entire lumen. surround kind coat surface microvilli
tucked little niches available tuck into.
take head pin look microscope, fit many, many
hundreds, not thousands little microbacteria. reason say
many, many thousands more, giving kind broad range there,
vary size and, again, vary whether not can move don't move.
Now, constantly turning gut, meaning born speak
dying off. will stay long periods time within


gut others will get excreted. 60% stool, unpleasant might
think about, made live dead microbacteria. constantly making
excreting microbacteria. microbacteria make many
stay inside gut many leave, meaning many excreted, depends
lot chemistry gut depends strongly foods eat
foods not eat. Now, just eat strongly influences
microbiome, meaning microbacteria, not mean not
influences constitutes microbiome. microbiome also made
microbacteria access digestive tract mouth, breathing,
kissing, skin contact. fact, one major determinants
microbiome interact environment happen in.
actually includes whether not interact animals. little bit, talk
data whether not grew home animals, whether not

environment shapes microbiome. simple point
eat influences microbiome, also do, think, feel,
many low microbacteria get digestive tract way

tell almost certainly impact brain function.
friends microbiologists, do, tell you, well, maybe brain

Nonetheless, taking advantage different environments along

people talk breathe you, people shake hands with,
people kiss don't kiss, people happen romantically

00:20:01 Roles Gut Microbiome

whatever pet happen impacting microbiome. absolutely no


question that. hopefully now sense architecture
digestive pathway sense trillions little microbacteria
living along different components digestive pathway. haven't
talked yet, like talk now, little microbiota
actually digestive tract. addition just living intents
purposes, contributing, instance, digestion. Many genes
microbiota make genes involved fermentation genes
involved digestion particular types nutrients. little bit, will talk
eat can actually change enzymes microbiome
components make, enzymes largely things responsible digestion.
catalyze sorts cellular events context digestive pathway,
talking enzymes help digest food. microbiota indeed
helping many ways. lack certain microbiota can help digest,
stands reason challenges digesting certain types foods.
amazing thing microbiota change way brain
functions way metabolizing facilitating metabolism particular
neurotransmitters. one ways certain microbiota present gut
can improve mood degrade mood, instance, way certain
microbiota converted facilitating conversion chemicals,
GABA. GABA call inhibitory neurotransmitter. involved suppressing
action neurons. might sound like bad thing, types
sedatives, instance, alcohol, lot neurons naturally make GABA can help
quiet certain circuits brain, instance, circuits responsible anxiety. people
epilepsy, GABAergic neurons, called, can often disrupted
signaling, meaning not cranking much GABA therefore
excitatory neurons, typically release molecules like glutamate can engage
called runaway excitation can give rise seizures. simple
message microbiota way making neurochemicals can influence
way brain functions. want support microbiota will give
tools support microbiota. takeaway point
microbiota making things locally help digest food. microbiota helping
make certain neurotransmitters like GABA, also talk dopamine
serotonin. specific microbiota reside gut profound
influence many, many biological functions,



00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting Stomach

especially immune system function, brain function, digestion. give
fairly complete picture gut microbiome. Now like talk
microbiome brain communicate, accurately, microbiome
rest nervous system communicate. Neurons, simply means nerve
cells, cells heavy lifting nervous system.
course cell types important. Glial cell, instance, very, important
cell types. endothelial cells, responsible blood flow, pericytes
types cells, neurons really heavy lifting
things think terms nervous system function.
neurons gut not surprise you. Neurons reside brain,
spinal cord, eyes, fact, body, got heart
heart, got lungs, got spleen,
connect different organs tissues body. not
surprising neurons gut. surprising, however,
presence particular types neurons reside near mucosal lining just next
lumen gut paying attention, explain mean
paying attention, components gut, nutrients microbiota,
thereby can send signals brain way long wire call axon,
can communicate chemistry nutritional quality
aspects environment gut given location brain
ways can influence brain to, instance, seek particular food. Let
give sort action-based picture this. say like people, enjoy
sweet foods. don't particularly enjoy sweet foods like.
sucker really good dark chocolate really good ice cream got thing
donuts seems just not quit although don't tend indulge often, like
them. eat particular food, obviously digestion starts mouth.
enzymes there, gets chewed up, food goes gut. neurons
activated, meaning causes neurons electrically active particular
components, certain nutrients foods present. cell types,
say neuron types matter here, nutrients really trigger
activation sugar, fatty acids, amino acids. Now, particular neurons


name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod
cells. Neuropod cells discovered Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University.
phenomenal set discoveries made mostly last 10 years. neuropod
cells, mentioned, activated sugar, fatty acids, amino acids,
particularly strong activation sugars. seem part sweet sensing

Bohorquez lab shown neuropod cells part network.

brain stations cause seek particular food. Now,
brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway
experience desire particular foods everything
foods taste. also do, probably know, texture sensation

actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go

highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give

gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation

performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,

right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut

basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope

especially immune system function, brain function, digestion. give
fairly complete picture gut microbiome. Now like talk

ways can influence brain to, instance, seek particular food. Let
give sort action-based picture this. say like people, enjoy
sweet foods. don't particularly enjoy sweet foods like.
sucker really good dark chocolate really good ice cream got thing
donuts seems just not quit although don't tend indulge often, like
them. eat particular food, obviously digestion starts mouth.
enzymes there, gets chewed up, food goes gut. neurons

components, certain nutrients foods present. cell types,
say neuron types matter here, nutrients really trigger
activation sugar, fatty acids, amino acids. Now, particular neurons


name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod

brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway
experience desire particular foods everything
foods taste. also do, probably know, texture sensation
foods mouth, even indeed go throat sometimes
can pleasing unpleasant. also subconscious
processing taste occurs gut itself. again, say gut, don't just
mean stomach. actually neurons, neuropod cells,
digestive tract signaling brain presence sweet foods,
well foods amino acid rich foods foods rich particular types
fatty acids signaling brain causing seek foods


consume foods. Now, probably asking, signal?
actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go
names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, forth. Sometimes
people refer neurotransmitters. Technically neuromodulators.

option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting
gastric distress spreading throughout day. also want mention brine.
Brine liquid surrounds sauerkraut. salty fluid. contains
lot active live cultures. include allowed people include brine
study. discussions Dr. Sonnenburg, go detail
episode comes next week, talk lot particular value brine
might hold terms bringing microbiota diversity richness live
cultures contains. want focus moment high fiber condition
interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,
undergraduate lab, think, well, won't him, now gone
medical school think passed residency practicing doctor,
nonetheless, always making kombucha home. told exceedingly
easy, again, number skills attributes made think


pretty much anything ease, whereas tend struggle even
basic cooking. maybe feeling little adventurous, explore
making kombucha. number different protocols recipes
making low-sugar fermented foods. needn't run
buy fresh sauerkraut time. also mention
interested getting fermented intake pickles, jarred pickles rarely ever
contain ferment. Mostly just soaked vinegar, water, spices,
contain ferment. actually look container.
don't know, maybe someone knows make natto knows

01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least


knowledge. studies shown, several, one published
journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie
sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, things sort. least
exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, category neurons can
respond artificial sweeteners signal information brain, pattern

artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. interesting
means first neurons incredible specificity terms

meaning doesn't calories despite sweet. Now, again,
subconscious processing. like previous studies just discussing

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
go really deep gut microbiome, less gut-brain axis,

00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting Stomach

especially immune system function, brain function, digestion. give
fairly complete picture gut microbiome. Now like talk
microbiome brain communicate, accurately, microbiome
rest nervous system communicate. Neurons, simply means nerve
cells, cells heavy lifting nervous system.
course cell types important. Glial cell, instance, very, important
cell types. endothelial cells, responsible blood flow, pericytes

things think terms nervous system function.
neurons gut not surprise you. Neurons reside brain,
spinal cord, eyes, fact, body, got heart
heart, got lungs, got spleen,

surprising neurons gut. surprising, however,
presence particular types neurons reside near mucosal lining just next
lumen gut paying attention, explain mean
paying attention, components gut, nutrients microbiota,
thereby can send signals brain way long wire call axon,
can communicate chemistry nutritional quality
aspects environment gut given location brain
ways can influence brain to, instance, seek particular food. Let
give sort action-based picture this. say like people, enjoy
sweet foods. don't particularly enjoy sweet foods like.
sucker really good dark chocolate really good ice cream got thing
donuts seems just not quit although don't tend indulge often, like
them. eat particular food, obviously digestion starts mouth.
enzymes there, gets chewed up, food goes gut. neurons
activated, meaning causes neurons electrically active particular
components, certain nutrients foods present. cell types,
say neuron types matter here, nutrients really trigger
activation sugar, fatty acids, amino acids. Now, particular neurons


name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod
cells. Neuropod cells discovered Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University.
phenomenal set discoveries made mostly last 10 years. neuropod
cells, mentioned, activated sugar, fatty acids, amino acids,
particularly strong activation sugars. seem part sweet sensing

Bohorquez lab shown neuropod cells part network.

brain stations cause seek particular food. Now,
brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway
experience desire particular foods everything
foods taste. also do, probably know, texture sensation
foods mouth, even indeed go throat sometimes
can pleasing unpleasant. also subconscious
processing taste occurs gut itself. again, say gut, don't just
mean stomach. actually neurons, neuropod cells,
digestive tract signaling brain presence sweet foods,
well foods amino acid rich foods foods rich particular types
fatty acids signaling brain causing seek foods


consume foods. Now, probably asking, signal?
actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go
names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, forth. Sometimes
people refer neurotransmitters. Technically neuromodulators.

also involve neurons. gut also communicating brain way
neurons, nerve cells. nerve cells also release hormones.
hormones go names like CCK, glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera. good
example hormone pathway, sometimes called hormone peptide

just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure

pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

name enteroendocrine cells recently defined neuropod
cells. Neuropod cells discovered Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University.
phenomenal set discoveries made mostly last 10 years. neuropod

particularly strong activation sugars. seem part sweet sensing

Bohorquez lab shown neuropod cells part network.

brain stations cause seek particular food. Now,
brings us classic experiments least incredible.
highly reproducible findings showing, instance, even bypass taste


infusing sweet liquid putting sweet foods gut, people can never taste
mouth, people will seek particular food. give
option sweet food infused gut bitter food infused
gut sweet versus sour, sweet versus less sweet food, people
selective preference sweet foods even can't taste them. Now, important
understand context gut-brain signaling always think like
sweet foods way taste. indeed still true, much
consider great taste sweet food also gut sensation
conscious detection. know that? Well, Bohorquez lab
performed experiments using modern methods classic experiments showing
animals humans will actively seek particular sweet food even
bypasses taste system. reverse also true. experiments
done animals humans allowed animals humans select eat
sweet foods, indeed given option. yet
somehow eliminate activation neurons within gut can sense sweet
foods. Now, couple different ways experiments ave done.
classic experiments date back '80s, done called
subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. means cutting off branch vagus
enervates gut diaphragm organs can still function
vagus important, basically cutting off sweet sensing
gut, still giving people opportunity taste sweet foods mouth,
don't actively seek quite much sweet food don't gut
sensing mechanism now know dependent neuropod cells.
recent experiments involve selective silencing neuropod cells.
lot different derivations sort thing, takeaway

can pleasing unpleasant. also subconscious
processing taste occurs gut itself. again, say gut, don't just
mean stomach. actually neurons, neuropod cells,
digestive tract signaling brain presence sweet foods,
well foods amino acid rich foods foods rich particular types
fatty acids signaling brain causing seek foods

actually make want foods without realizing it? Well,
adjusting release particular neuromodulators. not
familiar neuromodulators, similar neurotransmitters, tend act
broadly. tend impact many neurons go
names like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, forth. Sometimes
people refer neurotransmitters. Technically neuromodulators.
refer almost always neuromodulators. neuropod cells signal way

involved moderation reward, et cetera. turns area postrema,
vomit center brain stem, chockablock full dopamine receptors.
dopamine levels go high, can actually trigger vomiting. see
context various drugs used treat things like Parkinson's. Parkinson's
deficiency dopamine lack dopamine neurons typically causes resting
tremor, difficulty movement, dopamine's also associated lot
neural circuits movement. Many drugs used treat Parkinson's like L-DOPA
increase levels dopamine much, least activate dopamine receptors
great degree certain areas brain can cause activation things like
trigger vomit. Now, also make sense natural context gorge
food, gorge food, gorge food, neurons
gut respond simply detecting presence nutrients don't
really make decisions themselves. don't know stop eating. brain knows
stop eating eject food. wonderful thing neurons
communicating areas brain not just stimulate consuming food
communicating areas brain, instance, area postrema,
dopamine levels get high, cause us either stop eating food case


vomiting eject food. raise not give kind disgusting

controlled kind push-pull system, parallel pathways arriving
gut neurochemicals, case dopamine, used create two
opposite type behaviors, one behavior consume more, one behavior get rid
everything already consumed. brain actually sensitive amount

gorged point enough already. Now, course, mechanical
signals will also play area postrema vomiting reflex.
distended gut, feel lousy. just, actually can hurt badly, will
desire vomit, will just simply vomit. Mechanical chemical signals always

nicely neuronal signals gut brain, hormonal signals gut
brain, also includes microbiome, started talking
beginning episode. mentioned couple minutes ago, certain gut
microbiota can actually synthesize certain neurotransmitters can go impact
brain. actually knowledge microbiota can synthesize
particular neurotransmitters. instance, neuromodulator dopamine can
synthesized bacillus serratia. Now, just names microbiota.
don't expect necessarily recognize them. aren't sorts
things necessarily run buy get dopamine. point
particular gut microbiota can create dopamine gut can get

tend increase baseline levels dopamine. turns creating
right gut microbiome environment particular gut microbiota can thrive in,
well, baseline levels dopamine will elevated general, leads
enhancement mood. Similarly, gut microbiota, instance, candida,
streptococus, various enterococcus, always kind strange not
attractive names, least neurobiologist. Nonetheless, particular
microbiota support production can even metabolized serotonin,
neuromodulator associated mood, social interactions, huge number
different types events behaviors. Again, gut microbiota present


allowed thrive gut will increase overall levels serotonin riding top

whether not tend kind calm space whether not tend
somewhat irritable. course individual events go day, maybe
compliment get maybe somebody says something irritating us, whatever
may will also influence levels serotonin, serotonin events going

topic think lot people hear quite accurately, oh, 90 95%
serotonin manufactured gut. indeed true. manufactured
sorts microbiota just described. many, many experiments now,
mostly animal models, also humans show gut microbiome

people's mood suffers, maybe even immune system functions, maybe even

microbiota can literally raise baseline levels serotonin. indeed
gut microbiota like lactobacillus bifidobacterium, excuse me, hard complex
names pronounce, bifidobacterium can give rise increases GABA levels,
inhibitory neurotransmitter can act little bit mild sedative, can reduce

neuromodulators. Again, want emphasize still neurocircuits within
brain body specifically releasing potent way dopamine, serotonin,
GABA. two things act concert. Even though gut brain
acting parallel directly influencing one another, powerful synergistic

mostly performed animal models, typically mice, also studies humans
show creating correct environment gut microbiota thrive really


enhance mood wellbeing.

00:59:30 Gut Microbiome “Critical Periods”

gut microbiome not healthy, really can deplete mood

mentioned earlier, hundreds not thousands studies emphasizing key
role microbiome brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera. want just
highlight studies particular, recent studies come
labs working sort thing long time. One
exciting studies comes work Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab, Baylor
College Medicine. Mauro's lab working mouse models autism

parallel studies done, taking microbiomes people

microbiome potential impact health not context gut-to-brain
pathway rather context colitis. dates back studies '50s,
whereby people severe intractable colitis no treatment
going work received fecal transplants. yes, exactly sounds. Taking
stool healthy people not colitis, transplanting stools lower

rescue colitis. one first indications something within stool,
things, actually rescue another individual disease, sounds kind
wild crazy, may even sound disgusting you, mentioned
beginning episode, almost 60% stool live dead bacteria, microbiota,

quality. hard studies sorts reasons, getting appropriate
patient populations, getting agreement, et cetera, making sure everything's handled
properly. involves fecal transplants individuals lack particular
psychiatric condition metabolic condition people particular metabolic

powerful salient examples obesity. people even
ingest low numbers calories, even go liquid protein diet, simply can't
lose weight. somewhat rare disorders people either
get gastric bypass surgery. people now getting fecal transplants
people healthy weight take stool them, put lower
digestive tract, can see substantial improvement weight loss people
otherwise unable that. cases, actually can start eating relatively
normal levels food still lose weight. pretty remarkable tells us
something microbiota really powerful. Now, effects


generated isn't clear. One idea impacting metabolome, components
metabolism, almost certainly going case. Another idea
impacting neurotransmitters change behavior food choices within brain.
Although, mentioned, people already eating little food
begin little bit harder argument create. also
somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative
outcomes. negative outcomes underscore power microbiome
impacting bodily health. One key example this, instance, transfer fecal
matter another person order treat something like colitis effectively
that, donor stool, fecal matter happened obese
metabolic syndrome, observed recipient can also develop
metabolic syndrome simply way receiving donor's particular microbiota.
microbiota can create positive outcomes can create negative outcomes.
Now, us course, not interested pursuing fecal transplants.
people interested just creating healthy gut microbiome environment sake

whether not fasting not, tools useful. Now,
consider landmark study exploring relationship gut microbiome,
food intake, overall health paper Justin Sonnenburg's lab Chris
Gardner's lab, Stanford. paper entitled "Gut Microbiome-
Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status" published journal "Cell",
among three top journals perhaps world, "Nature", "Science",
"Cell" really apex journals overall science, especially biomedical
sciences. Now, interesting study. done humans. two
major groups. One group humans instructed increase amount fiber

fermented food diet. Now, groups started off not eaten lot fiber lot


fermented foods told increase amount either fiber fermented
foods ingesting four-week ramp period avoid
major gastric distress. turns not already accustomed eating
lot fiber, increasing amount fiber dramatically can cause gastric distress
ease time, see, mechanism behind this,
unveiled study, ease time, system can tolerate
it. Likewise high fermented foods can readily tolerated ramp phase
ingesting maybe one serving day, maybe two servings, ramping
case high six servings per day. However, ramp period, group
assigned high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake six weeks
high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake six weeks
went off either high fiber high fermented food diet
four-week follow period gradually returned baseline. Throughout
study gut microbiome evaluated diversity gut microbiota.

Regardless, study, explored sorts immune markers

paper contrary predicted, high fiber diet not lead
increased microbiota diversity, least not cases. somewhat
surprising. know, idea prebiotic fiber lot material fruits

proliferation existing microbiota. not observed, although want
clear pointing results not indicate fiber not useful
health overall, point fact increasing fiber intake not increase
microbiota diversity, general, mentioned before, associated
improvements microbiota function, health, overall wellbeing. Now, high
fermented food diet condition interesting. resulted increased microbiome
diversity decrease inflammatory signals activity. twofer.
Basically ingesting high fermented foods fair abundance, right? know, four


six servings per day lot fermented food intake. talk
foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased
inflammation brain body reduced significantly. Now, talk little bit
notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting
gastric distress spreading throughout day. also want mention brine.
Brine liquid surrounds sauerkraut. salty fluid. contains
lot active live cultures. include allowed people include brine
study. discussions Dr. Sonnenburg, go detail
episode comes next week, talk lot particular value brine
might hold terms bringing microbiota diversity richness live
cultures contains. want focus moment high fiber condition
interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,
undergraduate lab, think, well, won't him, now gone

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least

animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie

exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
go really deep gut microbiome, less gut-brain axis,

brain. actually knowledge microbiota can synthesize
particular neurotransmitters. instance, neuromodulator dopamine can
synthesized bacillus serratia. Now, just names microbiota.
don't expect necessarily recognize them. aren't sorts
things necessarily run buy get dopamine. point
particular gut microbiota can create dopamine gut can get

tend increase baseline levels dopamine. turns creating
right gut microbiome environment particular gut microbiota can thrive in,
well, baseline levels dopamine will elevated general, leads
enhancement mood. Similarly, gut microbiota, instance, candida,
streptococus, various enterococcus, always kind strange not
attractive names, least neurobiologist. Nonetheless, particular
microbiota support production can even metabolized serotonin,
neuromodulator associated mood, social interactions, huge number
different types events behaviors. Again, gut microbiota present


allowed thrive gut will increase overall levels serotonin riding top

baseline level serotonin might set overall mood, whether not wake

topic think lot people hear quite accurately, oh, 90 95%
serotonin manufactured gut. indeed true. manufactured
sorts microbiota just described. many, many experiments now,
mostly animal models, also humans show gut microbiome

people's mood suffers, maybe even immune system functions, maybe even
exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses. However, lot people take mean

microbiota can literally raise baseline levels serotonin. indeed
gut microbiota like lactobacillus bifidobacterium, excuse me, hard complex

neuromodulators. Again, want emphasize still neurocircuits within
brain body specifically releasing potent way dopamine, serotonin,
GABA. two things act concert. Even though gut brain
acting parallel directly influencing one another, powerful synergistic
effect. now hundreds studies, maybe even thousands point,
mostly performed animal models, typically mice, also studies humans
show creating correct environment gut microbiota thrive really


enhance mood wellbeing.

impacting neurotransmitters change behavior food choices within brain.
Although, mentioned, people already eating little food

somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.

study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota

words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated

option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting

microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,

disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even

severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated

course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might

many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain

microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High

things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either

don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not

stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

Basically ingesting high fermented foods fair abundance, right? know, four


six servings per day lot fermented food intake. talk
foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased
inflammation brain body reduced significantly. Now, talk little bit
notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting

interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can

well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High

severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated

right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure

pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed

even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit

within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

well, baseline levels dopamine will elevated general, leads

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure

pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed

impacting neurotransmitters change behavior food choices within brain.
Although, mentioned, people already eating little food
begin little bit harder argument create. also
somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative
outcomes. negative outcomes underscore power microbiome
impacting bodily health. One key example this, instance, transfer fecal

sorts microbiota just described. many, many experiments now,
mostly animal models, also humans show gut microbiome

mostly performed animal models, typically mice, also studies humans
show creating correct environment gut microbiota thrive really

mentioned earlier, hundreds not thousands studies emphasizing key

something microbiota really powerful. Now, effects


generated isn't clear. One idea impacting metabolome, components

impacting neurotransmitters change behavior food choices within brain.
Although, mentioned, people already eating little food
begin little bit harder argument create. also
somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative
outcomes. negative outcomes underscore power microbiome
impacting bodily health. One key example this, instance, transfer fecal
matter another person order treat something like colitis effectively
that, donor stool, fecal matter happened obese
metabolic syndrome, observed recipient can also develop
metabolic syndrome simply way receiving donor's particular microbiota.
microbiota can create positive outcomes can create negative outcomes.
Now, us course, not interested pursuing fecal transplants.

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods

Although, mentioned, people already eating little food

somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit

something microbiota really powerful. Now, effects

impacting neurotransmitters change behavior food choices within brain.
Although, mentioned, people already eating little food
begin little bit harder argument create. also
somewhat famous examples now fecal transplants can lead negative
outcomes. negative outcomes underscore power microbiome
impacting bodily health. One key example this, instance, transfer fecal

that, donor stool, fecal matter happened obese
metabolic syndrome, observed recipient can also develop
metabolic syndrome simply way receiving donor's particular microbiota.
microbiota can create positive outcomes can create negative outcomes.
Now, us course, not interested pursuing fecal transplants.

well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut

basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope

well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut

basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope

started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least

journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie

exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, category neurons can
respond artificial sweeteners signal information brain, pattern

brain actually quite bit different neurons responding
artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. interesting
means first neurons incredible specificity terms

meaning doesn't calories despite sweet. Now, again,

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg

just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure

pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic

01:23:49 Foods Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods

whether not fasting not, tools useful. Now,
consider landmark study exploring relationship gut microbiome,
food intake, overall health paper Justin Sonnenburg's lab Chris
Gardner's lab, Stanford. paper entitled "Gut Microbiome-
Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status" published journal "Cell",
among three top journals perhaps world, "Nature", "Science",
"Cell" really apex journals overall science, especially biomedical
sciences. Now, interesting study. done humans. two
major groups. One group humans instructed increase amount fiber
diet fact ate high fiber diet. group instructed eat high
fermented food diet. Now, groups started off not eaten lot fiber lot


fermented foods told increase amount either fiber fermented
foods ingesting four-week ramp period avoid
major gastric distress. turns not already accustomed eating
lot fiber, increasing amount fiber dramatically can cause gastric distress
ease time, see, mechanism behind this,
unveiled study, ease time, system can tolerate
it. Likewise high fermented foods can readily tolerated ramp phase
ingesting maybe one serving day, maybe two servings, ramping
case high six servings per day. However, ramp period, group
assigned high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake six weeks
high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake six weeks
went off either high fiber high fermented food diet
four-week follow period gradually returned baseline. Throughout
study gut microbiome evaluated diversity gut microbiota.
also number measures immune system function, particular
measures so-called inflammatome. immune system lot different
molecules involved. whole episode immune system interested
learning molecules are, various cytokines signaling molecules
reflect either high inflammation states reduced inflammation states brain
body. welcome check episode. also hubermanlab.com.
Regardless, study, explored sorts immune markers
expressed either two groups compared those. basic takeaway
paper contrary predicted, high fiber diet not lead
increased microbiota diversity, least not cases. somewhat
surprising. know, idea prebiotic fiber lot material fruits
vegetables grains forth supposed support microbiotal diversity
proliferation existing microbiota. not observed, although want
clear pointing results not indicate fiber not useful
health overall, point fact increasing fiber intake not increase
microbiota diversity, general, mentioned before, associated
improvements microbiota function, health, overall wellbeing. Now, high
fermented food diet condition interesting. resulted increased microbiome
diversity decrease inflammatory signals activity. twofer.
Basically ingesting high fermented foods fair abundance, right? know, four


six servings per day lot fermented food intake. talk
foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased
inflammation brain body reduced significantly. Now, talk little bit
notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting
gastric distress spreading throughout day. also want mention brine.
Brine liquid surrounds sauerkraut. salty fluid. contains
lot active live cultures. include allowed people include brine
study. discussions Dr. Sonnenburg, go detail
episode comes next week, talk lot particular value brine
might hold terms bringing microbiota diversity richness live
cultures contains. want focus moment high fiber condition
interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,
undergraduate lab, think, well, won't him, now gone
medical school think passed residency practicing doctor,
nonetheless, always making kombucha home. told exceedingly
easy, again, number skills attributes made think


pretty much anything ease, whereas tend struggle even
basic cooking. maybe feeling little adventurous, explore
making kombucha. number different protocols recipes
making low-sugar fermented foods. needn't run
buy fresh sauerkraut time. also mention
interested getting fermented intake pickles, jarred pickles rarely ever
contain ferment. Mostly just soaked vinegar, water, spices,
contain ferment. actually look container.
don't know, maybe someone knows make natto knows

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial

humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie

exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,

intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can
really obsessed kombucha something like that, avoid high cost
kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows
make kombucha home. never tried this, post doc,
undergraduate lab, think, well, won't him, now gone
medical school think passed residency practicing doctor,
nonetheless, always making kombucha home. told exceedingly
easy, again, number skills attributes made think


pretty much anything ease, whereas tend struggle even
basic cooking. maybe feeling little adventurous, explore
making kombucha. number different protocols recipes
making low-sugar fermented foods. needn't run
buy fresh sauerkraut time. also mention
interested getting fermented intake pickles, jarred pickles rarely ever
contain ferment. Mostly just soaked vinegar, water, spices,
contain ferment. actually look container.

01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners

even though separate gut microbiotal diversity reducing inflammation.
remiss didn't touch data controversy artificial
sweeteners gut microbiome. want clear tell
established animal models, mouse model, least


knowledge. studies shown, several, one published
journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie
sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, things sort. least
exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, category neurons can
respond artificial sweeteners signal information brain, pattern
signaling indeed signature pattern conveyed brain received
brain actually quite bit different neurons responding
artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. interesting
means first neurons incredible specificity terms
signaling gut brain. also means may particular
signal brain receives says receiving intake food drink
tastes sweet doesn't actually offer much nutrients direction sweetness,
meaning doesn't calories despite sweet. Now, again,
subconscious processing. like previous studies just discussing


artificial sweeteners generally gut microbiome generally, unclear

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg
go really deep gut microbiome, less gut-brain axis,
really deep gut microbiome, is, does, doesn't do,
emerging findings lab yet published. also excited
episode think many us heard gut microbiome.
hear bacteria live gut. hear gut-brain axis
90% serotonin make made gut. hear gut


second brain forth. think many people, don't really clear
picture gut microbiome pathways mechanisms can
signal brain parts body. hope today's information

01:23:49 Foods Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods

whether not fasting not, tools useful. Now,
consider landmark study exploring relationship gut microbiome,
food intake, overall health paper Justin Sonnenburg's lab Chris
Gardner's lab, Stanford. paper entitled "Gut Microbiome-
Targeted Diets Modulate Human Immune Status" published journal "Cell",
among three top journals perhaps world, "Nature", "Science",
"Cell" really apex journals overall science, especially biomedical
sciences. Now, interesting study. done humans. two
major groups. One group humans instructed increase amount fiber
diet fact ate high fiber diet. group instructed eat high
fermented food diet. Now, groups started off not eaten lot fiber lot


fermented foods told increase amount either fiber fermented
foods ingesting four-week ramp period avoid
major gastric distress. turns not already accustomed eating
lot fiber, increasing amount fiber dramatically can cause gastric distress
ease time, see, mechanism behind this,
unveiled study, ease time, system can tolerate
it. Likewise high fermented foods can readily tolerated ramp phase
ingesting maybe one serving day, maybe two servings, ramping
case high six servings per day. However, ramp period, group
assigned high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake six weeks
high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake six weeks
went off either high fiber high fermented food diet
four-week follow period gradually returned baseline. Throughout
study gut microbiome evaluated diversity gut microbiota.
also number measures immune system function, particular
measures so-called inflammatome. immune system lot different
molecules involved. whole episode immune system interested

reflect either high inflammation states reduced inflammation states brain
body. welcome check episode. also hubermanlab.com.
Regardless, study, explored sorts immune markers

paper contrary predicted, high fiber diet not lead
increased microbiota diversity, least not cases. somewhat
surprising. know, idea prebiotic fiber lot material fruits

clear pointing results not indicate fiber not useful
health overall, point fact increasing fiber intake not increase
microbiota diversity, general, mentioned before, associated
improvements microbiota function, health, overall wellbeing. Now, high
fermented food diet condition interesting. resulted increased microbiome
diversity decrease inflammatory signals activity. twofer.
Basically ingesting high fermented foods fair abundance, right? know, four


six servings per day lot fermented food intake. talk
foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased
inflammation brain body reduced significantly. Now, talk little bit
notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing
inflammation. think important point. make point, especially
lot people, even ramp phase, six servings per day
fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six
ounce servings, six, four six ounce servings. not six servings listed
package. again, turns fair amount fermented foods.
gauge whether not getting enough this? Well, decide


take protocol ingesting fermented foods, least read
study follow work done, sounds like terrific idea
want improve gut microbiome great reasons one want to,
brain-body health, reduced inflammation, on, well definitely want
focus fermented foods enjoy consuming. kefir,
plain yogurt, sauerkraut, happens personal
favorite, want make sure going something going
enjoy ingesting quite lot going okay ingesting probably
throughout day. Now, people follow different meal schedules, course,
require not just eating fermented foods just bedtime one meal.
suppose that, general, going work best terms limiting
gastric distress spreading throughout day. also want mention brine.
Brine liquid surrounds sauerkraut. salty fluid. contains
lot active live cultures. include allowed people include brine
study. discussions Dr. Sonnenburg, go detail
episode comes next week, talk lot particular value brine
might hold terms bringing microbiota diversity richness live
cultures contains. want focus moment high fiber condition
interesting observations people placed
condition. First all, increasing amount fiber definitely increased
number enzymes can used digest fiber. keeping idea
ramp phase accumulation fiber intake can time lead less
gastric distress also utilization fiber overall good thing.
didn't observe increase immune system function increase
microbiota diversity, increase fiber digesting enzymes. also
observed called personalized immune responses.
subgroups within high fiber group interesting changes terms
reactions to, say inflammatome, meaning inflammatory markers
expressed, well microbiota diversity. essentially three groups.
One group actually showed increase inflammatory markers. quite
surprising probably not wonderful message fiber always good us
small cohort within fiber intake group. Another group still another
group, showed reductions baseline microbiota diversity although varying
degrees. don't want paint picture fiber bad fiber certainly not


positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain

exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing

01:44:27 Structure & Function Gut-Brain Axis

humans well, although still remains determined empirically. like
just briefly recap covered today. started off talking structure
function gut-brain axis. described basic structure function digestive
pathway, digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many,
many little bacteria can signal sorts things rest brain body.
indeed, talked various ways that. talked direct
pathways, literally nerve networks extend gut brain
brain back gut. talked indirect pathways, gut
microbiota can actually synthesize neurotransmitters get bloodstream,
can impact body, can impact immune system, can get brain act
neurotransmitters brain just neurotransmitters originate
within brain. also talked constitutes healthy versus unhealthy
microbiome. clear diverse microbiome healthier
non-diverse microbiome. pointed out, still lot questions
exactly microbiota species want enhance ones want
suppress gut order achieve best gut-brain axis function. talked
things like fasting might impact microbiome might
little bit counterintuitive based positive effects fasting,
not just discussing fasting, types somewhat restrictive diets either
restrictive time restrictive terms macronutrient intake, may may
not improve health gut microbiome. basic takeaway
don't know exactly specific diets impact gut microbiome, don't know
fasting either promotes degrades microbiome, really can't say whether not
improving degrading microbiome time. However, clear
stress, particular chronic stress, can disrupt gut microbiome. also clear,
course, antibiotics can disrupt gut microbiome. brings us topic


prebiotics probiotics. emphasized fact people, ingesting high
quality non-processed foods includes prebiotic fiber also includes
probiotics will probably healthy not excessive levels probiotics. High
levels supplemented probiotics sort come probiotic pill even
prescription probiotics probably lend best people
severe chronic stress just come off serious round ongoing repeated
rounds antibiotics. not mean ingesting probiotics form
kind not good. just means high dose probiotics, again, typically found
prescription form capsule pill form probably best reserved cases
course doctor prescribes them. always follow doctor's advice.
cases perhaps jetlagged, traveling excessively reason,
working excessively, not getting enough sleep, diet radically changed
normal. talked increasing amount fiber diet might
useful increasing fiber digesting enzymes assimilation fibrous foods
really ingestion fermented foods and, fact, getting anywhere four
even six servings day fermented foods can immensely beneficial
reducing inflammatory markers body improving microbiota diversity
along gut thereby improving signaling outcomes along gut-brain axis.
went way structure function four kinds signaling, mechanical,
chemical, indirect, direct, probiotics, fiber, fermented foods. tossed little bit
end also ways can make fermented foods home
order try offset costs. Also, just kind fun do.
actually taste quite good. actually found fermented sauerkraut
making home actually rivals sauerkraut can buy
refrigerated section grocery store. no means skilled cook chef
basically no culinary skill whatsoever. can it, can it. hope
found information useful perhaps also actionable. One motivations
episode was, again, primer episode Dr. Justin Sonnenburg

foods were. outcome positive. clear increase
microbiome diversity decreased inflammatory signals. things like interleukin-6,
number interleukins cytokines associated increased

notion number servings, et cetera. One somewhat minor point
study, think useful terms taking actionable stance
number servings fermented foods not strong predictor improvements
inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation improvements microbiota
diversity, duration time individuals ingesting fermented foods.
words, longer one consistently ingesting fermented foods daily
basis, better outcomes terms gut microbiome reducing

fermented foods can seem like quite lot. fermented foods? think
many us familiar certain cheeses fermented beer
fermented kombucha fermented. study, focus specifically low-sugar
fermented foods. plain yogurt, cases, kimchi sauerkraut.
important consideration, however, needs contain called live active
cultures, means actually microbiota alive inside
sauerkraut. One way know whether not happening purchase
sauerkraut pickles kimchi jar container non-refrigerated
shelf non-refrigerated section grocery store, not going contain live
active cultures microbiota. likewise, consume yogurt lot sugar
components added it, not going positive effect
microbiome, least prediction given relationship
sorts microbiota live sugar versus plain type yogurts. gave people
option consuming number different low-sugar fermented food.
sauerkraut, kimchi, things like kefir, natto. Japan, consume natto
fermented food. Beer not one fermented foods included
fermented food list. say six servings per day, indeed six, six

positive effects microbiota diversity high fermented food diet did.
read study, think stance many others taken
consequence data, increasing fermented food intake,
simply good thing order support gut microbiome
reduce inflammatory signals brain body. number different
ways that. mentioned particular foods. However, anytime
talking ingesting fermented foods, especially high quality ones come
refrigerated section grocery store, low sugar content, et cetera,
considerate cost certain things like kombuchas,
instance, can quite costly. also mention kombuchas actually contain
alcohol, not, contain little amounts alcohol. One way avoid high
cost fermented foods still able accumulate lot fermented food
intake simply make fermented foods yourself. something
started exploring experimenting home. One simple way
just make sauerkraut. involves ingredients. basically involves
cabbage, water, salt, specific process need follow order
create large volumes sauerkraut home using low cost method.
best resource know order follow great recipe make homemade
sauerkraut recipe homemade sauerkraut contained Tim
Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef". excellent protocol there. involves
chopping cabbage, putting bowl, mashing hands, can
fun, putting water there, salt, covering it, keeping particular
environment, routinely scraping off material surface.
order make sure not getting microbes things growing
bad you. definitely want pay careful attention protocol,
very, low cost way generating lots lots fermented foods
don't go broke trying improve microbiome. thing can

kombucha ways can get scoby, basically allows

knowledge. studies shown, several, one published
journal "Nature" years back one got amount attention
animals consume large amounts artificial sweeteners. particular things like
saccharin sucralose show disruptions gut microbiome. not aware
studies humans show equivalent effect. not aware studies
humans show equivalent effect things like plant-based, low-calorie
sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, things sort. least
exploration, couldn't find data specifically related sweetener aspartame.
right now somewhat controversial actually kind third rail topic
there. one group will come saying artificial sweeteners bad
disrupt gut microbiome, response generally number people
well, shown animal models. indeed true. right now
don't think strong case one way other. think people
basically ask whether not like artificial sweeteners not, whether
not willing risk not, obviously individual choice. also want
point recent study Diego Bohorquez's lab, actually shows, however,
neurons gut, neuropod cells, actually capable distinguishing
real sugars artificial sweeteners. really interesting body work.
published just now, just recently, say, February 2022. title paper
"The Preference Sugar Sweetener Depends Gut Sensor Cell".
make long story short, showed category neuropod cells
recognize sugar gut signal information presence sugar
gut brain via pathways talked before, nodose ganglia, vagus,
dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, category neurons can
respond artificial sweeteners signal information brain, pattern
signaling indeed signature pattern conveyed brain received
brain actually quite bit different neurons responding
artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. interesting
means first neurons incredible specificity terms
signaling gut brain. also means may particular
